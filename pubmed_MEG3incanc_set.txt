TI  - MEG3: an Oncogenic Long Non-coding RNA in Different Cancers.
PG  - 859-874

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently considered as central regulators in 
      diverse biological processes and emerged as vital players controlling tumorigenesis. 
      Several lncRNAs can be classified into oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes 
      depending on their function in cancer. A maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) gene 
      transcripts a 1.6 kb lncRNA whose act as an antitumor component in different cancer 
      cells, such as breast, liver, glioma, colorectal, cervical, gastric, lung, ovarian 
      and osteosarcoma cancer cells. The present review highlights biological function of 
      MEG3 to repress tumor through regulating the major tumor suppressor genes p53 and 
      Rb, inhibiting angiogenesis-related factor, or controlling miRNAs. On the other 
      hand, previous studies have also suggested that MEG3 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT). However, deregulation of MEG3 is associated with the  development 
      and progression of cancer, suggesting that MEG3 may function as a potential 
      biomarker and therapeutic target for human cancers.

AB  - LncRNAs are emerging as integral functional and regulatory components of normal 
      biological activities and are now considered as critically involved in the 
      development of different diseases including cancer. In this review, we summarized 
      recent findings on maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a noncoding lncRNA, locates 
      in the imprinted DLK1-MEG3 locus on human chromosome 14q32.3 region. MEG3 is 
      expressed in normal tissues but is either lost or decreased in many human tumors and 
      tumor derived cell lines. Studies have demonstrated that MEG3 is associated with 
      cancer initiation, progression, metastasis and chemo-resistance. MEG3 may affect the 
      activities of TP53, MDM2, GDF15, RB1 and some other key cell cycle regulators. In 
      addition, the level of MEG3 showed good correlation with cancer clinicopathological 
      grade. In summary, MEGs is an RNA-based tumor suppressor and is involved in the 
      etiology, progression, and chemosensitivity of cancers. The alteration of MEG3 
      levels in various cancers suggested the possibility of using MEG3 level for cancer 
      diagnosis and prognosis.

TI  - lncRNA MEG3 inhibit proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer via p53 signaling 
      pathway.
PG  - 3850-3856
LID - 13346 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: lncRNA MEG3 has been reported as a tumor suppressor gene in many 
      different kinds of cancer, but its role in gastric cancer has not been fully 
      understood. Then, we would like to explore its mechanism in gastric cancer. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: We first used qRT-PCR to detect the expression of lncRNA MEG3, then 
      CCK8 and wound healing assay were used to detect the effect of lncRNA MEG3 on 
      gastric cancer cells. Western blot assay was used to measure the expression of p53 
      when lncRNA MEG3 was overexpressed. RESULTS: lncRNA MEG3 was highly expressed in the 
      adjacent tissue, compared to the one in gastric cancer tissue. What's more, we also 
      found that overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 could decrease the proliferation and 
      metastasis of gastric cancer cells. Finally, overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 could 
      also increase the expression of p53. CONCLUSIONS: lncRNA MEG3 could inhibit the 
      proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer.

TI  - LncRNA MEG3 inhibits the progression of prostate cancer by modulating miR-9-5p/QKI-5 
      axis.
PG  - 29-38
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.13658 [doi]
AB  - This study was designed to detecting the influences of lncRNA MEG3 in prostate 
      cancer. Aberrant lncRNAs expression profiles of prostate cancer were screened by 
      microarray analysis. The qRT-PCR and Western blot were employed to investigating the 
      expression levels of lncRNA MEG3, miR-9-5p and QKI-5. The luciferase reporter assay 
      was utilized to testifying the interactions relationship among these molecules. 
      Applying CCK-8 assay, wound healing assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry in 
      turn, the cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities as well as apoptosis 
      were measured respectively. LncRNA MEG3 was a down-regulated lncRNA in prostate 
      cancer tissues and cells and could inhibit the expression of miR-9-5p, whereas 
      miR-9-5p down-regulated QKI-5 expression. Overexpressed MEG3 and QKI-5 could 
      decrease the abilities of proliferation, migration and invasion in prostate cancer 
      cells effectively and increased the apoptosis rate. On the contrary, miR-9-5p mimics 
      presented an opposite tendency in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, MEG3 inhibited 
      tumour growth and up-regulated expression of QKI-5 in vivo. LncRNA MEG3 was a 
      down-regulated lncRNA in prostate cancer and impacted the abilities of cell 
      proliferation, migration and invasion, and cell apoptosis rate, this regulation 
      relied on regulating miR-9-5p and its targeting gene QKI-5.

TI  - Non-Coding RNAs in Breast Cancer: Intracellular and Intercellular Communication.
LID - 10.3390/ncrna4040040 [doi]
LID - 40
AB  - Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are regulators of intracellular and intercellular signaling 
      in breast cancer. ncRNAs modulate intracellular signaling to control diverse 
      cellular processes, including levels and activity of estrogen receptor α (ERα), 
      proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis, and stemness. In addition, ncRNAs can 
      be packaged into exosomes to provide intercellular communication by the transmission 
      of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to cells locally or 
      systemically. This review provides an overview of the biogenesis and roles of 
      ncRNAs: small nucleolar RNA (snRNA), circular RNAs (circRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs 
      (piRNAs), miRNAs, and lncRNAs in breast cancer. Since more is known about the miRNAs 
      and lncRNAs that are expressed in breast tumors, their established targets as 
      oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors will be reviewed. The focus is on miRNAs and 
      lncRNAs identified in breast tumors, since a number of ncRNAs identified in breast 
      cancer cells are not dysregulated in breast tumors. The identity and putative 
      function of selected lncRNAs increased: nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 
      (NEAT1), metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), steroid 
      receptor RNA activator 1 (SRA1), colon cancer associated transcript 2 (CCAT2), 
      colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE), myocardial infarction 
      associated transcript (MIAT), and long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, Regulator 
      of Reprogramming (LINC-ROR); and decreased levels of maternally-expressed 3 (MEG3) 
      in breast tumors have been observed as well. miRNAs and lncRNAs are considered 
      targets of therapeutic intervention in breast cancer, but further work is needed to 
      bring the promise of regulating their activities to clinical use.

AB  - Prolonged infection of uterine cervix epithelium with human papillomavirus (HPV) and 
      constitutive expression of viral oncogenes have been recognized as the main cause of 
      the complex molecular changes leading to transformation of cervical epithelial 
      cells. Deregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNA), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), 
      and circular RNAs (circRNA) is involved in the initiation and promotion processes of 
      cervical cancer development. Expression profiling of small RNAs in cervical 
      neoplasia revealed up-regulated "oncogenic" miRNAs, such as miR-10a, miR-21, miR-19, 
      and miR-146a, and down regulated "tumor suppressive" miRNAs, including miR-29a, 
      miR-372, miR-214, and miR-218, associated with cell growth, malignant 
      transformation, cell migration, and invasion. Also several lncRNAs, comprising among 
      others HOTAIR, MALAT1, GAS5, and MEG3, have shown to be associated with various 
      pathogenic processes such as tumor progression, invasion as well as therapeutic 
      resistance and emerged as new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cervical 
      cancer. Moreover, human genes encoded circular RNAs, such as has_circ-0018289, have 
      shown to sponge specific miRNAs and to concur to the deregulation of target genes. 
      Viral encoded circE7 has also demonstrated to overexpress E7 oncoprotein thus 
      contributing to cell transformation. In this review, we summarize current literature 
      on the complex interplay between miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs and their role in 
      cervical neoplasia.

TI  - Clinical Value of lncRNA MEG3 in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as regulators in cancer development and 
      progression, and aberrant lncRNA profiles have been reported in several cancers. 
      Here, we evaluated the potential of using the maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) 
      tissue level as a prognostic marker in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the 
      most common and deadliest gynecologic malignancy. To the aim of the study, we 
      measured MEG3 transcript levels in 90 pre-treatment peritoneal biopsies. We also 
      investigated MEG3 function in ovarian cancer biology. We found that high MEG3 
      expression was independently associated with better progression-free (p = 0.002) and 
      overall survival (p = 0.01). In vitro and in vivo preclinical studies supported a 
      role for MEG3 as a tumor suppressor in HGSOC, possibly through modulation of the 
      phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) network. Overall, results from this study 
      demonstrated that decreased MEG3 is a hallmark for malignancy and tumor progression 
      in HGSOC.

AB  - The present study aimed to explore the diagnostic and prognostic value of lncRNA 
      maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) in cervical cancer. Eighty-four patients with cervical 
      cancer from February 2013 to March 2014 were enrolled in the observation group (OG), 
      and another 58 female subjects who underwent physical examination at Huangshi 
      Central Hospital were enrolled as the control group (CG). The serum MEG3 expression 
      of patients in the two groups was detected by RT-qPCR, and the ability of MEG3 to 
      aid in the diagnosis of cervical cancer, lymph node metastasis and FIGO staging, as 
      well as to predict mortality was evaluated by ROC curve. In addition, the patients 
      in the OG were divided into high- and low-expression groups according to the median 
      value of MEG3. Kaplan Meier was employed to analyze the survival status, and Cox 
      regression to analyze the independent prognostic factors of cervical cancer 
      patients. The results of the present study revealed that the serum MEG3 expression 
      in the OG was significantly lower than that of the CG (P<0.05). The area under the 
      curve (AUC) of MEG3 in diagnosing cervical cancer was 0.844, the AUC in predicting 
      mortality was 0.858, while that in diagnosing lymph node transfer was 0.707, and 
      that in diagnosing FIGO staging was 0.791. The 5-year survival rate of the 
      high-expression group was higher than that of the low-expression group (P=0.020). 
      Multivariate analysis indicated that MEG3 (HR, 0.173; 95 CI%, 0.028-0.919), lymph 
      node metastasis (HR, 2.259; 95 CI%, 1.004-5.025) and FIGO staging (HR, 0.008; 95 
      CI%, 1.453-6.248) were independent prognostic factors for cervical cancer patients. 
      Collectively, lncRNA MEG3 may be a diagnostic marker and prognostic indicator for 
      cervical cancer, and has a certain diagnostic value for lymph node metastasis and 
      FIGO staging. Lymph node metastasis, FIGO stage III and IV, and low MEG3 levels were 
      revealed to be independent prognostic factors for cervical cancer patients.

TI  - Cisplatin Induces Pyroptosis via Activation of MEG3/NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD Pathway in 
      Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.
PG  - 2606-2621
LID - 10.7150/ijbs.60292 [doi]
AB  - Cisplatin (DDP) was reported to improve pathological complete response (pCR) rates 
      in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, however, the molecular mechanism 
      still remains largely unknown. Emerging evidence suggested that some 
      chemotherapeutic drugs played anti-tumor effects by inducing cell pyroptosis. 
      Nevertheless, whether pyroptosis contributes to the DDP-induced anti-tumor effect in 
      TNBC remains unexploited. In the present study, NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptosis 
      pathway was involved in the DDP-induced anti-tumor effect of TNBC in vitro and in 
      vivo, providing evidence that DDP might induce pyroptosis in TNBC. Moreover, DDP 
      activated NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway by up-regulating the long 
      non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3). Furthermore, knockdown 
      of MEG3 not only partly abolished the activation effect of DDP on 
      NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway-mediated pyroptosis, but also reversed the suppression 
      of DDP on tumor growth and metastasis ability in vitro and in vivo, further 
      confirming that MEG3 may partially mediate the pyroptotic signaling upon DDP 
      treatment. Thus, our data uncovered a novel mechanism that DDP induced pyroptosis 
      via activation of MEG3/NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway in TNBC to exert anti-tumor 
      effects, which may help to develop new strategies for the therapeutic interventions 
      in TNBC.

PG  - 1750-1757

AB  - BACKGROUND: Out of 3 billion base pairs in human genome only ~2% code for proteins; 
      and out of 180,000 transcripts in human cells, about 20,000 code for protein, 
      remaining 160,000 are non-coding transcripts. Most of these transcripts are more 
      than 200 base pairs and constitute a group of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Many of 
      the lncRNA have its own promoter, and are well conserved in mammals. Accumulating 
      evidence indicates that lncRNAs act as molecular switches in cellular 
      differentiation, movement, apoptosis, and in the reprogramming of cell states by 
      altering gene expression patterns. However, the role of this important group of 
      molecules in angiogenesis is not well understood. Angiogenesis is a complex process 
      and depends on precise regulation of gene expression. CONCLUSION: Dysregulation of 
      transcription during this process may lead to several diseases including various 
      cancers. As angiogenesis is an important process in cancer pathogenesis and 
      treatment, lncRNA may be playing an important role in angiogenesis. In support of 
      this, lncRNA microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (MVIH) has been 
      shown to activate angiogenesis. Furthermore, lncRNA-Meg3-knockout mouse showed 
      increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor pathway genes and 
      increased cortical microvessel density. Overall, there is strong evidence that 
      lncRNA is an important class of regulatory molecule, and a number of studies have 
      demonstrated that these can be targeted to change cellular physiology and functions. 
      In this review, we have attempted to summarize these studies and elucidate the 
      potential of this novel regulatory molecule as a therapeutic target.

AB  - Early-stage detection of BC is a critical factor for effective treatment of the 
      disease and can increase the survival rate of BC patients. Long non-coding RNAs can 
      act as miRNA decoys by sequestering miRNAs, thus acting as competing endogenous RNAs 
      and leading to re-expression of miRNA target genes. Maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) is 
      LncRNA and it was reported to be tumor suppressor in breast cancer. The study aims 
      to investigate the effect of MEG3 SNP (rs7158663 G/A) and its association with 
      breast cancer risk in the Egyptian population. In addition, demonstrate the 
      consequence of the MEG3 polymorphism on the expression levels of MEG3, miR-182, and 
      miRNA-29. MEG3 rs7158663 G/A was genotyped and serum MEG3, miRNA-182, and miRNA-29 
      were measured in 180 breast cancer, 120 FA, and 150 controls by the qPCR. 
      Frequencies of MEG3 rs7158663 GA/AA genotype and A allele were significantly higher 
      in BC patients compared to the controls results showed that serum MEG3 levels were 
      significantly lower, according to the presence of the A allele in different study 
      groups while the expression of miR-182 and miRNA 29 were significantly elevated. 
      MEG3, miR-182, and miRNA-29 are key genes involved in the development of BC, are 
      considered as a novel potential non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for BC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MEG3 downregulated the expression in several tumors and inhibits human 
      tumorigenesis. But so far, the mechanism of MEG3 in tumorigenesis is still unclear. 
      METHODS: In gene infection, cellular and molecular technologies and tumorigenesis 
      test in vitro and in vivo were performed, respectively. RESULTS: Our results 
      indicate that MEG3 enhances the P53 expression by triggering the loading of P300 and 
      RNA polymerase II onto its promoter regions dependent on HP1α. Moreover, MEG3 
      increases the methylation modification of histone H3 at the 27th lysine via P53. 
      Furthermore, MEG3 inhibits the expression of TERT by increasing the H3K27me3 in TERT 
      promoter regions, thereby inhibiting the activity of telomerase by reducing the 
      binding of TERT to TERC. Furthermore, MEG3 also increases the expression of TERRA; 
      therefore, the interaction between TERC and TERT was competitively attenuated by 
      increasing the interaction between TERRA and TERT, which inhibits the activity of 
      telomerase in hLCSCs. Strikingly, MEG3 reduces the length of telomere by blocking 
      the formation of complex maintaining telomere length (POT1-Exo1-TRF2-SNM1B) and 
      decreasing the binding of the complex to telomere by increasing the interplay 
      between P53 and HULC. Ultimately, MEG3 inhibits the growth of hLCSCs by reducing the 
      activity of telomerase and attenuating telomeric repeat binding factor 2(TRF2). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrates MEG3 inhibits the occurrence of human liver 
      cancer by blocking telomere, and these findings provide an important insight into 
      the prevention and treatment of human liver cancer.

AB  - Within the non-coding genome landscape, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their 
      secretion within exosomes are a window that could further explain the regulation, 
      the sustaining, and the spread of lung diseases. We present here a compilation of 
      the current knowledge on lncRNAs commonly found in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
      Disease (COPD), asthma, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), or lung cancers. We 
      built interaction networks describing the mechanisms of action for COPD, asthma, and 
      IPF, as well as private networks for H19, MALAT1, MEG3, FENDRR, CDKN2B-AS1, TUG1, 
      HOTAIR, and GAS5 lncRNAs in lung cancers. We identified five signaling pathways 
      targeted by these eight lncRNAs over the lung diseases mentioned above. These 
      lncRNAs were involved in ten treatment resistances in lung cancers, with HOTAIR 
      being itself described in seven resistances. Besides, five of them were previously 
      described as promising biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of asthma, COPD, 
      and lung cancers. Additionally, we describe the exosomal-based studies on H19, 
      MALAT1, HOTAIR, GAS5, UCA1, lnc-MMP2-2, GAPLINC, TBILA, AGAP2-AS1, and SOX2-OT. This 
      review concludes on the need for additional studies describing the lncRNA mechanisms 
      of action and confirming their potential as biomarkers, as well as their involvement 
      in resistance to treatment, especially in non-cancerous lung diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is an imprinted gene with 
      maternal expression, which may function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting 
      angiogenesis. To identify the prognostic value of MEG3 in breast cancer, systematic 
      analysis was performed in this study. METHODS: To evaluate gene alteration during 
      breast carcinogenesis, we explored MEG3 expression using the Serial Analysis of Gene 
      Expression Genie suite and Oncomine analysis. The prognostic roles of MEG3 in breast 
      cancer were investigated using the PrognoScan database. The heat map and methylation 
      status of MEG3 were determined using the UCSC Genome Browser. RESULTS: We found that 
      MEG3 was more frequently downregulated in breast cancer than in normal tissues and 
      this correlated with prognosis. However, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor 
      status were found to be positively correlated with MEG3 expression. Conversely, 
      basal-like status, triple-negative breast cancer status, and Scarff Bloom & 
      Richardson grade criterion were negatively correlated with MEG3 expression. 
      Following data mining in multiple big data databases, we confirmed a positive 
      correlation between MEG3 and heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2) expression in 
      breast cancer tissues. CONCLUSION: MEG3 could be adopted as a marker to predict the 
      prognosis of breast cancer with HSPG2. However, large-scale and comprehensive 
      research is needed to clarify our results.

AB  - Enormous studies have corroborated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) extensively 
      participate in crucial physiological processes such as metabolism and immunity, and 
      are closely related to the occurrence and development of tumors, cardiovascular 
      diseases, nervous system disorders, nephropathy, and other diseases. The application 
      of lncRNAs as biomarkers or intervention targets can provide new insights into the 
      diagnosis and treatment of diseases. This paper has focused on the emerging research 
      into lncRNAs as pharmacological targets and has reviewed the transition of lncRNAs 
      from the role of disease coding to acting as drug candidates, including the current 
      status and progress in preclinical research. Cutting-edge strategies for lncRNA 
      modulation have been summarized, including the sources of lncRNA-related drugs, such 
      as genetic technology and small-molecule compounds, and related delivery methods. 
      The current progress of clinical trials of lncRNA-targeting drugs is also discussed. 
      This information will form a latest updated reference for research and development 
      of lncRNA-based drugs.

TI  - Long Non-Coding RNA MEG3 in Cellular Stemness.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22105348 [doi]
LID - 5348
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate a diverse array of cellular processes at the 
      transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. 
      Accumulating evidence suggests that lncRNA MEG3 exerts a large repertoire of 
      regulatory functions in cellular stemness. This review focuses on the molecular 
      mechanisms by which lncRNA MEG3 functions as a signal, scaffold, guide, and decoy 
      for multi-lineage differentiation and even cancer progression. The role of MEG3 in 
      various types of stem cells and cancer stem cells is discussed. Here, we provide an 
      overview of the functional versatility of lncRNA MEG3 in modulating pluripotency, 
      differentiation, and cancer stemness.

TI  - LncRNA MEG3 inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in laryngeal cancer 
      via miR-23a/APAF-1 axis.
PG  - 6708-6719
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.14549 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) MEG3 serves a regulatory role in the progression of 
      several types of cancer, but the role of MEG3 in laryngeal cancer is still unknown. 
      The aim of this study was to explore the regulatory role and mechanism of MEG3 in 
      laryngeal cancer. MEG3 expression in 50 laryngeal cancer tissue samples was detected 
      by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The 
      effects of MEG3 overexpression on laryngeal cancer cells were investigated in vitro 
      and in vivo. The mechanism of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) was validated 
      through luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR and Western blotting. MEG3 was 
      down-regulated in laryngeal cancer tissues, and the low MEG3 expression was 
      associated with advanced clinical stage. Additionally, MEG3 overexpression inhibited 
      the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of laryngeal cancer cells in vitro and 
      in vivo. Particularly, MEG3 bound to miR-23a specifically and a reciprocal negative 
      regulation existed between miR-23a and MEG3. Moreover, MEG3 up-regulated apoptotic 
      protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1), a known miR-23a's target, thereby leading to 
      the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Meanwhile, these activated effects were 
      rescued by miR-23a overexpression. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated 
      that MEG3 functions as a novel tumour suppressive LncRNA in laryngeal cancer for the 
      first time. Furthermore, MEG3 may act as a ceRNA to regulate APAF-1 expression by 
      competitive binding to miR-23a, thereby regulating the progression of laryngeal 
      cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: LncRNA MEG3 expressed abnormally in various cancers including breast 
      cancer, but no studies reported the correlation between MEG3 SNPs and breast cancer 
      susceptibility among Chinese women. METHODS: This study is aimed to explore the 
      association between three SNPs of MEG3 (rs3087918, rs7158663, rs11160608) and breast 
      cancer. The study is a population-based case-control study including 434 breast 
      cancer patients and 700 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using Sequenom 
      MassArray technique. Function prediction of rs3087918 were based on RNAfold and 
      lncRNASNP2 databases. RESULTS: Pooled analysis indicated that rs3087918 was related 
      to a decreased risk of breast cancer [GG vs. TT: OR (95%) = 0.67(0.45-0.99), 
      P = 0.042; GG vs. TT + TG: OR (95%) = 0.69(0.48-0.99), P = 0.046], especially for 
      women aged <=49 [GG vs. TT: OR (95%) = 0.40(0.22-0.73), P = 0.02]. Comparison 
      between case groups showed genotype GG and TG/GG of rs3087918 were associated with 
      her-2 receptor expression [GG vs. TT: OR (95%) = 2.37(1.24-4.63), P = 0.010; TG + GG 
      vs. TT: OR (95%) = 1.50(1.01-2.24), P = 0.045]. We didn't find statistical 
      significance for rs11160608, rs7158663 and breast cancer. Structure prediction based 
      on RNAfold found rs3087918 may influence the secondary structure of MEG3. The 
      results based on lncRNASNP2 indicated that rs3087918 may gain the targets of 
      hsa-miR-1203 to MEG3, while loss the target of hsa-miR-139-3p and hsa-miR-5091 to 
      MEG3. CONCLUSIONS: MEG3 rs3087918 was associated with a decreased risk of breast 
      cancer. MEG3 haplotype TCG may increase the risk of breast cancer.

TI  - Long non-coding RNA expression in bladder cancer.
PG  - 1205-1213
LID - 10.1007/s12551-017-0379-y [doi]
AB  - The advent of novel high-throughput sequencing methods has facilitated 
      identification of non-coding RNAs with fundamental roles in cellular biological and 
      pathological conditions. A group of these consisting of at least 200 nucleotides are 
      called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Their participation in the pathogenesis of 
      cancer has been highlighted in recent years. Bladder cancer, one of the most 
      prevalent cancers worldwide, exhibits altered expression levels of several lncRNAs. 
      Several in vitro and in vivo studies have assessed the effects of silencing RNAs on 
      cancer cell phenotypes and in vivo tumor growth. For instance, in vitro studies have 
      shown that nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), promoter of CDKN1A 
      antisense DNA damage-activated RNA(PANDAR) and metastasis-associated lung 
      adenocarcinoma transcript 1(MALAT1) have oncogenic effects while Maternally 
      expressed 3 (MEG3) and BRAF activated non-coding RNA (BANCR) are tumor suppressors. 
      Analysis of these data will help to identify a panel of lncRNAs that can be 
      potentially used for both early detection and prognosis in bladder cancer patients. 
      Here, we review the roles of several lncRNAs in the oncogenesis, tumor suppression, 
      early detection, and prognosis of bladder cancer.

TI  - Long non-coding RNA MEG3 mediates the miR-149-3p/FOXP3 axis by reducing p53 
      ubiquitination to exert a suppressive effect on regulatory T cell differentiation

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) has been 
      implicated in the progression of esophageal cancer (EC). However, the specific 
      mechanism of the involvement of MEG3 in EC development in relation to the regulation 
      of immune escape remains uncertain. Thus, the aim of the current study was to 
      investigate the effect of MEG3 on EC via microRNA-149-3p (miR-149-3p). METHODS: 
      Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were initially performed in EC cells in 
      addition to the establishment of a 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide-induced EC mouse model 
      aimed at evaluating the respective roles of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), MEG3, 
      miR-149-3p, mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and p53 in T cell differentiation 
      and immune escape observed in EC. RESULTS: EC tissues were found to exhibit 
      upregulated FOXP3 and MDM2 while MEG3, p53 and miR-149-3p were all downregulated. 
      FOXP3 was confirmed to be a target gene of miR-149-3p with our data suggesting it 
      reduced p53 ubiquitination and degradation by means of inhibiting MDM2. P53 was 
      enriched in the promoter of miR-149-3p to upregulate miR-149-3p. The overexpression 
      of MEG3, p53 or miR-149-3p or silencing FOXP3 was associated with a decline in 
      CD25(+)FOXP3(+)CD4(+) T cells, IL-10(+)CD4(+) T cells and IL-4(+)CD4(+) T cells in 
      spleen tissues, IL-4, and IL-10 levels as well as C-myc, N-myc and Ki-67 expression 
      in EC mice. CONCLUSION: Collectively, MEG3 decreased FOXP3 expression and resulted 
      in repressed regulatory T cell differentiation and immune escape in EC mice by 
      upregulating miR-149-3p via MDM2-mediated p53.

TI  - Relationship between MEG3 gene polymorphism and risk of gastric cancer in Chinese 
      population with high incidence of gastric cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gastric cancer is the most common gastrointestinal malignancy in China 
      and results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The present 
      study was conducted to investigate the relationship between long noncoding RNA 
      (lncRNA) materally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
      and the risk of gastric cancer and to construct a genetic-environmental risk 
      assessment model. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted to include 474 
      patients with gastric cancer diagnosed by clinical and pathological examination and 
      543 healthy physical examination subjects. Blood samples, general demographic data 
      and behavioral lifestyle of the subjects were collected. The TaqMan real-time PCR 
      method was used for testing the genotypes of MEG3 rs7158663 and rs10132552. RESULTS: 
      The A allele at the rs7158663 loci of MEG3 was found to be risk factor for gastric 
      cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 1.41, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.14-1.74, 
      P=0.002). Yet, no significant association between rs10132552 polymorphisms and 
      gastric cancer was observed. Drinking, tea drinking and preserved food eating were 
      risk factors for gastric cancer (P<0.05). A genetic-environmental risk assessment 
      model was established by using the logistic regression model to include MEG3 
      rs7158663, drinking, tea drinking, and preserved food eating. With the increase in 
      risk score (RS), the risk of gastric cancer increased substantially (P<0.05). And 
      the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.745, which 
      indicates a high diagnostic value. CONCLUSIONS: MEG3 rs7158663 might be associated 
      with the risk of gastric cancer; the diagnostic ability of genetic-environmental 
      risk assessment model for gastric cancer is better.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC), a common tumor, is characterized by a high mortality rate. 
      Long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) serves a regulatory role in 
      the carcinogenesis and progression of several types of cancer; however, its role in 
      CRC remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the regulatory 
      role and mechanism(s) of MEG3 in CRC. The Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis is 
      characteristic of the metabolism of tumor cells. To determine the effect of MEG3 on 
      glycolysis of CRC cells, we used an XF analyzer to perform glycolysis stress test 
      assays and found that overexpression of MEG3 significantly inhibited glycolysis, 
      glycolytic capacity, as well as lactate production in CRC cells, whereas knockdown 
      of MEG3 produced the opposite effect. Mechanistically, overexpression of MEG3 
      induced ubiquitin-dependent degradation of c-Myc and inhibited c-Myc target genes 
      involved in the glycolysis pathway such as lactate dehydrogenase A, pyruvate kinase 
      muscle 2, and hexokinase 2. Moreover, we found that MEG3 can be activated by vitamin 
      D and vitamin D receptor (VDR). Clinical data demonstrated that MEG3 was positively 
      associated with serum vitamin D concentrations in patients with CRC. We found that 
      1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment increased MEG3 expression, and knockdown of VDR abolished 
      the effect of MEG3 on glycolysis. These results indicate that vitamin D-activated 
      MEG3 suppresses aerobic glycolysis in CRC cells via degradation of c-Myc. Thus, 
      vitamin D may have therapeutic value in the treatment of CRC.

TI  - The overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 inhibits cell viability and invasion and promotes 
      apoptosis in ovarian cancer by sponging miR-205-5p.
PG  - 869-879
AB  - PURPOSE: Ovarian cancer is a common and fatal cancer in women. The long non-coding 
      RNA (lncRNA) MEG3 was reported to affect the cellular processes of ovarian cancer, 
      but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the potential 
      regulatory mechanism of MEG3 in ovarian cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A reverse 
      transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was conducted to 
      analyze the expression levels of MEG3 and miR-205-5p in tissues and cell lines. An 
      MTT assay was utilized to determine the cell viability of ovarian cancer SKOV-3 and 
      OVCAR-8 cells. A flow cytometry analysis was employed to disclose the ovarian cancer 
      cell apoptosis. The migration and invasion of SKOV-3 and OVCAR-8 cells were examined 
      using a Transwell assay. A bioinformatics analysis indicated miR-205-5p as a direct 
      target of MEG3, and a luciferase reporter assay was conducted to validate the 
      interaction between MEG3 and miR-205-5p. RESULTS: MEG3 was significantly 
      down-regulated, while miR-205-5p was up-regulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cell 
      lines. The overexpression of MEG3 and the knockdown of miR-205-5p inhibited cell 
      viability, migration and invasion but promoted the apoptosis rate in ovarian cancer 
      cells. MiR-205-5p was identified as a downstream gene of MEG3 and is negatively 
      regulated by MEG3. The introduction of miR-205-5p reversed the up-regulation of 
      MEG3-mediated suppression effects on cell viability, migration and invasion and 
      increased cell apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. CONCLUSION: The overexpression of 
      lncRNA MEG3 inhibits cell proliferation and cell invasion and promotes apoptosis in 
      ovarian cancer by sponging miR-205-5p.

TI  - Long noncoding RNA MEG3 suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion, 
      induces apoptosis and paclitaxel-resistance via miR-4513/PBLD axis in breast cancer 
      cells.

AB  - Breast cancer remains a general-threat event in the health of women. Currently, 
      increasing records indicate that long non-coding RNA maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) 
      plays a central role in breast cancer. The current research focused on the function 
      of MEG3 in paclitaxel (PTX)-resistance and human breast cancer growth. Levels of 
      MEG3, microRNA (miR)-4513, and phenazine biosynthesis-like domain-containing protein 
      (PBLD) were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      (qRT-PCR) or western blot assays. 
      3-(4.5-dimethylghiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay was 
      performed to examine the IC(50) of PTX and cell proliferation in breast cancer 
      cells. In addition, cell apoptosis was determined utilizing flow cytometry. 
      Transwell was conducted to assay cell migration and invasion in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 
      cells. The interaction between miR-4513 and MEG3 or PBLD was expounded via 
      dual-luciferase reporter assay. Levels of MEG3 and PBLD were decreased, but miR-4513 
      level was triggered in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of MEG3 
      could reinforce cell apoptosis, impede proliferation, migration, invasion, and the 
      IC50 of PTX in breast cancer cells. Moreover, the impact of miR-4513 inhibitor on 
      cell progression and PTX-resistance was overturned by MEG3 deficiency. 
      Interestingly, miR-4513 mimic could abolish the role of PBLD upregulation in cell 
      behaviors and PTX-resistance in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Finally, the expression 
      of PBLD was co-modulated by miR-4513 and MEG3 in vitro. MEG3/miR-4513/PBLD axis 
      modulated PTX-resistance and the development of breast cancer cells, which might 
      provide a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.

TI  - LncRNA MEG3 enhances cisplatin sensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer by 
      regulating miR-21-5p/SOX7 axis.
PG  - 5137-5149
LID - 10.2147/OTT.S146423 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to play essential role 
      in drug resistance of multiple cancers. LncRNA MEG3 was previously reported to be 
      associated with cisplatin (DDP) resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
      cells. However, the molecular mechanism of MEG3 affecting DDP resistance in NSCLC 
      remains to be further illustrated. In this study, we attempted to discuss whether 
      MEG3 also could function as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate DDP resistance in 
      NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of MEG3, miR-21-5p, and sex-determining 
      region Y-box 7 (SOX7) in NSCLC tissues or cells was examined by quantitative 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 
      3-(4,5-Dimethylthazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), flow cytometry, 
      and caspase-3 activity analysis were applied to assess the DDP sensitivity of NSCLC 
      cells. The interaction between MEG3, miR-21-5p, and SOX7 was explored by luciferase 
      reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blot. 
      Mouse NSCLC transplanted tumor was established to verify the functional role of MEG3 
      in DDP resistance in vivo. RESULTS: MEG3 was downregulated in DDP-resistant NSCLC 
      cells. Overexpression of MEG3 enhanced DDP sensitivity of NSCLC cells in vitro. MEG3 
      directly interacted with miR-21-5p and suppressed its expression. miR-21-5p 
      significantly abolished the effects of MEG3 on DDP resistance via modulating cell 
      proliferation and apoptosis. SOX7 was identified as a direct target of miR-21-5p and 
      MEG3 positively regulated SOX7 expression by suppressing miR-21-5p. Moreover, MEG3 
      knockdown-induced pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects were reversed in 
      DDP-resistant NSCLC cells by upregulating SOX7. Furthermore, upregulation of MEG3 
      induced sensitivity of NSCLC cells to DDP in vivo. CONCLUSION: MEG3 overexpression 
      induced DDP sensitivity of NSCLC cells by regulating miR-21-5p/SOX7 axis, shedding 
      light on the molecular mechanism of MEG3 involved in the development of DDP 
      resistance of NSCLC cells.

TI  - LncRNA MEG3 inhibits rheumatoid arthritis through miR-141 and inactivation of 
      AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.
PG  - 7116-7120
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.14591 [doi]
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammation mediated by autoimmune 
      responses. MEG3, a kind of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), participates in cell 
      proliferation in cancer tissues. However, the correlation between MEG3 and RA is yet 
      unclear. Therefore, to clarify how MEG3 works in RA, we performed a series of 
      experiments using RA samples. We found that MEG3 was downregulated in the 
      fibroblast-like synoviocytes of RA patients (RA-FLS), in comparison with healthy 
      subjects. MEG3 was also down-regulated evidently in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated 
      chondrocyte. As part of our experiments, MEG3 was overexpressed in chondrocyte by 
      transfection with lentivirus containing sequences encoding MEG3. In addition, in 
      presence of LPS, reductions were identified not only in the cell proliferation, but 
      also in the generation of interleukin-23 (IL-23), which, however were reversed in 
      the lentivirus (containing MEG3-encoding sequences)-transfected chondrocytes. 
      Up-regulated MEG3 resulted in an increase the level of Ki67. Moreover, MEG3 was 
      negatively correlated with miR-141, and miR-141 was up-regulated in LPS-treated 
      chondrocyte. Inhibitory effects of MEG3 overexpression, mentioned above, were 
      partially abolished by overexpressed miR-141. Further, animal experiment also showed 
      the inhibitory effect of MEG3 in overexpression on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. 
      In-vivoexperiments also showed that cell proliferation was facilitated by MEG3 
      overexpression with inhibited inflammation. In summary, the protective role of MEG3 
      in RA was proved to be exerted by the increase in the rate of proliferation, which 
      might correlate to the regulatory role of miR-141 and AKT/mTOR signal pathway, 
      suggesting that MEG3 holds great promise as a therapeutic strategy for RA.

TI  - LncRNA meg3 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and vivo studies.
PG  - 4089-4099
AB  - Although abnormal expression of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MEG3 has been 
      reported in multiple cancer types, the role of MEG3 in the pathobiology of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. This study evaluated the expression 
      of lncRNA MEG3 and a microRNA (miRNA-10a-5p) implicated in HCC metastasis in cancer 
      and carcinoma adjacent tissues of HCC samples (n=30 each) via in situ hybridization 
      and quantitative RT-PCR. The effects of overexpressing either MEG3 alone, or MEG3 in 
      combination with miRNA-10a-5p, on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle 
      progression, migration, and invasion of HepG2 cells were evaluated using functional 
      assays. Dual luciferase reporter assays and western blotting were employed to 
      delineate the mechanisms of MEG3 and miRNA-10a-5p regulation of key oncogenes and 
      tumor suppressors in HCC cells. Compared to carcinoma-adjacent regions, MEG3 
      expression was downregulated in cancer regions of HCC samples; by contrast, 
      miRNA-10a-5p was overexpressed in cancer regions compared to tumor-adjacent areas. 
      Furthermore, overexpression of MEG3 (a) decreased proliferation, migration, and 
      invasion of HepG2 cells; (b) enhanced apoptosis and the proportion of HepG2 cells in 
      G1 of the cell cycle; (c) increased the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog 
      (PTEN), Bcl2-associated X (Bax), and p53 proteins; and (d) decreased the expression 
      of miRNA-10a-5p, AKT, p-AKT, Bcl-2, and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-2 and 
      -9. Furthermore, miRNA-10a-5p bound the 3-untranslated region of PTEN mRNA and 
      downregulated PTEN protein expression. Taken together, these data suggest that MEG3 
      regulates the PTEN/AKT/MMP-2/MMP-9 signaling axis and contributes to HCC development 
      by targeting miRNA-10a-5p.

AB  - Accumulating evidence has revealed that dysregulated lncRNA expression contributes 
      to the onset and progression of cancer. However, the mechanistic role of lncRNA in 
      glioma progression and tumor immunology remains largely unknown. This study aimed to 
      evaluate the significance of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in the prognosis of 
      and its immune-related roles in gliomas. The expression levels of MEG3 were analyzed 
      using Oncomine and TIMER database. As an important imprinted gene, the copy number 
      variation (CNV) of MEG3 in both glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and low-grade glioma 
      (LGG) were analyzed using GSCALite database, whereas its prognostic significance was 
      assessed using PrognoScan and GEPIA databases. The relationship between MEG3 and 
      tumor-infiltrated immune cells was analyzed using TIMER. Results showed that MEG3 
      expression was lower in most of the human cancer tissues than in the normal tissues. 
      We also found that heterozygous deletion of MEG3 occurred more frequent than 
      heterozygous amplification in gliomas, and mRNA expression of MEG3 was significantly 
      positively correlated with its CNV in both the GBM and LGG group. Survival analysis 
      showed that the CNV level of MEG3 had significant correlation with overall survival 
      (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with wild type in LGG. Lower MEG3 
      expression was related with poor prognosis. Further analysis showed that in GBM, 
      MEG3 expression level was significantly positively correlated with that of 
      infiltrating CD8(+) T cells and significantly negatively correlated with that of 
      infiltrating dendritic cells. In LGG, MEG3 expression level was significantly 
      negatively correlated with levels of infiltrating B cells, CD8(+) T cells, CD4(+) T 
      cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Univariate Cox survival 
      analysis demonstrated that only the level of infiltrating dendritic cells 
      significantly affected the survival time of patients with GBM, while all six types 
      of immune cells had a significant effect on the survival time of patients with LGG. 
      Furthermore, MEG3 expression showed strong correlations with multiple immune markers 
      in gliomas, especially in LGG. The current findings suggest that MEG3 expression 
      might serve as a possible prognostic marker and potential immunotherapeutic target 
      for gliomas.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was made to investigate whether long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) 
      MEG3 could participate in the occurrence and development of non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC) by regulating the expression of BRCA1 through competitive binding to 
      microRNA-7-5p. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain 
      Reaction (qRT-PCR) to explore the expression of lncRNA MEG3 and BRCA1 in NSCLC 
      tissues and adjacent normal tissues, as well as NSCLC cell lines. The dual 
      luciferase reporter gene assay was used to detect the binding of microRNA-7-5p to 
      lncRNA MEG3 and BRCA1. Meanwhile, the expression of BRCA1, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) 
      and BCL2-associated X (Bax) was detected by Western blot after the cells were 
      overexpressed or knocked down of lncRNA MEG3. All these experiments were designed to 
      investigate whether lncRNA MEG3 participated in the pathogenesis of NSCLC through 
      inhibiting the expression of BRCA1 and Bcl-2 and promoting Bax expression. RESULTS: 
      The expressions of lncRNA MEG3 and BRCA1 in NSCLC tissues and A549 and HCC823 cell 
      lines were significantly lower than those in the normal group. Overexpression of 
      lncRNA MEG3 and BRCA1 in A549 and HCC823 cell lines resulted in increased apoptosis 
      of lung cancer cells. Dual luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that lncRNA MEG3 
      can regulate the expression of BRCA1 through competitively binding to microRNA-7-5p 
      to form the lncRNA MEG3/microRNA-7-5p/BRCA1 regulatory network. Besides, lncRNA MEG3 
      could inhibit the apoptosis inhibitory protein Bcl-2 and promote the expression of 
      apoptosis-promoting factor Bax. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA MEG3 was significantly 
      downregulated in NSCLC, and it could regulate the BRCA1 expression by competitive 
      binding to microRNA-7-5p.

TI  - Association of LncRNA MEG3 polymorphisms with efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
      in breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, and neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy has been recommended to the patients with locally advanced breast 
      cancer as the initial treatments. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MEG3, an identified 
      tumor suppressor, has been implicated in the development of various cancers. 
      However, there is no data to evaluate the effect of MEG3 polymorphisms on 
      neoadjuvant treatment in the breast cancer. METHODS: Genotyping was performed using 
      Nanodispenser Spectro CHIP chip spotting and Mass ARRAY Compact System. Univariate 
      and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the associations 
      between the MEG3 polymorphisms and the pathological complete response (pCR). The 
      disease-free survival (DFS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and 
      multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the hazard 
      ratios (HRs) with a 95% confidential interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 144 patients 
      with available pretreatment blood species were enrolled in the SHPD002 clinic trial 
      of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. MEG3 rs10132552 were significantly 
      associated with good response (Adjusted OR = 2.79, 95% CI 1.096-7.103, p = 0.031) in 
      dominant model. Median follow-up time was 20 months. In multiple regression 
      analysis, rs10132552 TC + CC (adjusted HR = 0.127, 95% CI 0.22-0.728, p = 0.02) and 
      rs941576 AG + GG (adjusted HR = 0.183, 95% CI 0.041-0.807, p = 0.025) were 
      significantly associated with good DFS. MEG3 rs7158663 (OR = 0.377, 95% CI 
      0.155-0.917, p = 0.032) were associated with a low risk of hemoglobin decrease in 
      dominant models. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA MEG3 polymorphisms were associated with the 
      chemotherapy response and toxicity of paclitaxel and cisplatin. The result indicates 
      that MEG3 polymorphisms can be considered as the predictive and prognostic markers 
      for the breast cancer patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent malignancy and has 
      the fourth highest global cancer mortality rate. Early diagnosis and prompt medical 
      attention can improve quality of life and the prognosis of CRC patients. 
      Accumulating evidence reveals that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as 
      oncogenes or anti-oncogenes, as well as biomarkers in various cancers. AIM: To 
      investigate the levels and molecular mechanism of the lncRNA maternally expressed 
      gene 3 (MEG3) in CRC. METHODS: The levels of lncRNA MEG3 in CRC tissue, serum and 
      cell line samples were explored via qRT-PCR. The relationship between MEG3 levels 
      and clinicopathological features in CRC was investigated. The diagnostic and 
      prognostic values of serum MEG3 levels were analyzed with ROC curves and 
      Kaplan‑Meier survival curves, respectively. RESULTS: Significant decreased levels of 
      MEG3 existed in CRC tissue, cell lines and serum. CRC patients with down-regulated 
      serum MEG3 levels had larger tumor sizes, and advanced clinical stages. The 
      sensitivity and specificity of serum MEG3 levels in CRC detection was 0.667 and 
      0.875, respectively. Tumor size, T stages, and serum MEG3 levels are indie factors 
      that produce an effect on CRC patients' prognosis. Kaplan‑Meier survival curves 
      suggested that CRC patients with high levels of MEG3 had a remarkably better overall 
      survival rate. CONCLUSION: LncRNA MEG3 is down-regulated in CRC, and regulates cell 
      functions by targeting adenosine deaminase's effect on RNA 1 in CRC.

AB  - Although the association of MEG3 gene rs7158663 polymorphism with cancer 
      susceptibility has been investigated, the findings are inconsistent. The aim of this 
      study was to analyze the association between the rs7158663 polymorphism and cancer 
      susceptibility through a case-control study and meta-analysis. In a case-control 
      study with 430 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases and 445 healthy controls, the rs7158663 
      polymorphism was genotyped by direct sequencing. STATA software was used to 
      calculate the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence interval in a meta-analysis 
      including 4,649 cancer cases and 5,590 controls. Both the case-control study and 
      meta-analysis showed that the rs7158663 polymorphism was associated with increased 
      susceptibility to CRC. Individuals carrying the AA or GA genotype were more likely 
      to develop CRC than those carrying the rs7158663 GG genotype. Interestingly, MEG3 
      expression was significantly lower in colorectal tissues of the AA or GA genotype 
      compared to those of the rs7158663 GG genotype. In addition, the meta-analysis 
      suggested that the rs7158663 polymorphism was also associated with increased 
      susceptibility to breast cancer and gastric cancer. Bioinformatics analysis showed 
      that the rs7158663 A allele contributed to the binding of hsa-miR-4307 and 
      hsa-miR-1265 to MEG3. In conclusion, the current findings suggest that the MEG3 gene 
      rs7158663 polymorphism may serve as a genetic marker for predicting the risk of 
      cancers, such as breast cancer, gastric cancer and CRC. However, the sample size of 
      the current study is still insufficient, especially in the subgroup analysis. 
      Therefore large and well-designed studies are needed to validate our findings.

TI  - MEG3 promotes liver cancer by activating PI3K/AKT pathway through regulating AP1G1.
PG  - 1459-1467
LID - 17103 [pii]
LID - 10.26355/eurrev_201902_17103 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the biological function of maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in liver cancer and the potential mechanism of 
      phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway in regulating 
      proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative 
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to examine the level of 
      MEG3 in 72 pairs of liver cancer tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues. 
      Expression levels of MEG3 and AP1G1 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines including 
      SMMC-7721 and BEL-7402 were detected. After transfection of MEG3-siRNA or AP1G1 
      overexpression plasmid, the proliferative and invasive abilities of hepatoma cells 
      were detected through cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and cell invasion assay. The 
      effects of MEG3 and AP1G1 on the cell cycle of hepatoma cell lines were examined 
      using flow cytometry. Western blot was conducted to estimate the changes in the 
      protein levels of AP1G1, p-PI3K, p-AKT and VEGF before and after transfection. 
      RESULTS: The level of MEG3 in hepatoma cancer tissues and cell lines was 
      significantly reduced, especially in patients with advanced liver cancer. Knockdown 
      of MEG3 significantly promoted proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells, but 
      accelerated cell cycle. Western blot analysis revealed that knockdown of MEG3 
      reduced the level of AP1G1 and activated the PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, rescue 
      experiments demonstrated that overexpression of AP1G1 partially reversed the 
      promotive effect of lowly-expressed MEG3 on cell proliferation and invasion, 
      suggesting that low expression of MEG3 may activate PI3K/AKT pathway by inhibiting 
      AP1G1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Low expression of MEG3 could promote the 
      proliferative and invasive abilities of hepatoma cells and accelerate cell cycle. 
      The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of AP1G1 expression and activation of 
      PI3K/AKT pathway.

TI  - MEG3/miR‑21 axis affects cell mobility by suppressing epithelial‑mesenchymal 
      transition in gastric cancer.
PG  - 39-48
LID - 10.3892/or.2018.6424 [doi]
AB  - The prognosis of patients with gastric cancer remains poor mainly due to distant 
      metastasis. Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA), is 
      downregulated in various tumor tissues and suppresses tumor progression. miR‑21 is a 
      microRNA which is expressed highly in tumor tissues. In the present study, we 
      investigated the relationship between MEG3 and miR‑21 in regards to the cell 
      mobility of gastric cancer. Our data demonstrated that MEG3 was downregulated while 
      miR‑21 was upregulated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines by qRT‑PCR. 
      Overexpression of MEG3 suppressed cell mobility of gastric cancer cells (AGS) by 
      downregulating the expression of MMP‑3, MMP‑9 and VEGF. As shown by western blot 
      analysis, overexpression of MEG3 also suppressed epithelial‑mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT) by increasing the expression of an epithelial marker (E‑cadherin) and 
      downregulating the expression of mesenchymal markers (N‑cadherin, Snail and 
      β‑catenin), indicating that MEG3 suppressed cell mobility through the inhibition of 
      EMT in gastric cancer. The expression of miR‑21 was negatively regulated by MEG3 and 
      overexpression of miR‑21 promoted cell mobility of AGS through activation of EMT. 
      Co‑transfection of lncRNA‑MEG3 and miR‑21 mimic counteracted the inhibitory effect 
      on the cell mobility attributed to MEG3, suggesting that the MEG3/miR‑21 axis 
      affects cell mobility by suppressing EMT in gastric cancer. Using a mouse xenograft 
      tumor model, we found that the overexpression of MEG3 suppressed tumor growth and 
      metastasis while overexpression of miR‑21 had the opposite effects. The MEG3/miR‑21 
      axis affected gastric cancer growth and metastasis through inhibition of EMT 
      in vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the MEG3/miR‑21 axis participates in 
      the tumor progression and metastasis of gastric cancer through the regulation of 
      EMT.

TI  - LncRNA MEG3 promotes the sensitivity of vincristine by inhibiting autophagy in lung 
      cancer chemotherapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, the 
      morbidity and mortality of which have been on rising in recent years. Moreover, 
      lncRNAs have been implicated in the development of various cancers, as well as 
      cancer treatment and prognosis. In this study, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MEG3, an 
      identified tumor suppressor, was explored for its role in the chemotherapy of lung 
      cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases were divided into (I+II) group and (III+IV) 
      group according to different stages of tumor node metastasis (TNM), and were divided 
      into sensitive group and insensitive group according to chemotherapy sensitivity. 
      A549 and H292 cells were selected as the resistant cell and non-resistant lung 
      cancer cells. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 
      was performed to detect the expression of MEG3. After transfection with 
      overexpression plasmid pcDNA-MEG3 or/and different concentrations of vincristine, 
      cell viability and proliferation were measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay 
      and plate cloning assay, respectively. Western blotting was used to analyze the 
      expressions of autophagy-related proteins. RESULTS: In vivo, lncRNA MEG3 was 
      significantly lower in III+IV group and insensitive group than that in I+II group 
      and sensitive group. In vitro, MEG3 expression in resistant cells was significantly 
      lower than that in non-resistant cells. Overexpression of MEG3 significant inhibited 
      the viability and proliferation of both resistant and non-resistant lung cancer 
      cells. Western blot results showed that autophagy level was higher in resistant 
      cells than that in non-resistant cells, while overexpression of MEG3 significantly 
      reduced the expression of autophagy-related proteins. CCK-8 results also indicated 
      that the cell viability was negatively correlated with the dose of vincristine, 
      while the viability of drug-resistant cells was higher than that of non-drug 
      resistant cells after the treatment of vincristine. The vitality of both cells 
      decreased in a concentration-dependent manner after combined treatment with 
      vincristine and MEG3. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that lncRNA MEG3 showed a low 
      expression in chemotherapy-sensitive lung cancer tissues, and overexpression of 
      lncRNA MEG3 attenuated autophagy level, thus increasing the sensitivity of 
      vincristine in chemotherapy of lung cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the association between MEG3 polymorphisms and the risk of 
      prostate cancer in the Chinese Han population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two MEG3 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs11627993 C >T rs7158663 A>G) were 
      genotyped in a case-control study in which 165 prostate cancer patients and 200 
      healthy controls were recruited by a Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with 
      the TaqMan assay. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used 
      to estimate the strength of association. RESULTS: No statistically significant 
      differences were found in the allele or genotype distributions of the MEG3 
      rs11627993 C >T and rs7158663 A > G polymorphisms among cases or healthy control 
      subjects (rs11627993: CC vs CA: 95% CI = 0.54-1.95, ORs = 1.03; CC vs AA: 95% CI = 
      0.67-2.54, ORs = 1.30 ; CC/CA vs AA: 95% CI = 0.81-1.98, ORs = 1.26 , P = .29 ; C vs 
      A: 95% CI = 0.85-1.57, ORs = 1.16, P = .35; rs7158663: AA vs AG: 95% CI = 0.76-5.08, 
      ORs = 1.97, AA vs GG: 95% CI = 0.57-3.29, ORs = 1.37; AA/AG vs GG : 95% CI = 
      0.56-1.32, ORs = 0.86, P = .49; A vs G: 95% CI = 0.69-1.39, ORs = 0.98, P = .91) 
      Further stratified analysis detected no significant association. CONCLUSION: The 
      MEG3 polymorphisms (rs11627993 C>T and rs7158663 A>G) does not influence the 
      susceptibility to prostate cancer.

TI  - Aberrant Methylation-Mediated Silencing of lncRNA MEG3 Functions as a ceRNA in 
      Esophageal Cancer.
PG  - 800-810
LID - 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-16-0385 [doi]
AB  - Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), has 
      tumor-suppressor properties and its expression is lost in several human tumors. 
      However, its biological role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) 
      tumorigenesis is poorly defined. The present study determined the role and 
      methylation status of MEG3 in esophageal cancer cells and ESCC clinical specimens, 
      and further observed the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) activity of MEG3 in the 
      pathogenesis and development of ESCC. Significant downregulation of MEG3 was 
      detected in esophageal cancer cells and ESCC tissues and the expression level of 
      MEG3 was significantly increased in cancer cells after treated with the DNA 
      methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-dC. Upregulation of MEG3 led to the inhibition of 
      proliferation and invasiveness of the cancer cells. The aberrant promoter 
      hypermethylation of MEG3 indicates silencing of its expression. Furthermore, MEG3 
      acts as a ceRNA to regulate the expression of E-cadherin and FOXO1 by binding 
      hsa-miR-9. Upregulation of miR-9 was detected in esophageal cancer cell lines and 
      ESCC tissues, and miR-9 promoted esophageal cancer cell proliferation and invasion. 
      Finally, downregulation and hypermethylation of MEG3 was associated with ESCC 
      patients' survival.Implications: MEG3 functions as a tumor-suppressive lncRNA and 
      aberrant promoter hypermethylation is critical for MEG3 gene silencing in ESCC. In 
      addition, MEG3 acts as a ceRNA to regulate expression of E-cadherin and FOXO1 by 
      competitively binding miR-9 and may be used as a potential biomarker in predicting 
      ESCC patients' progression and prognosis. Mol Cancer Res; 15(7); 800-10. ©2017 AACR.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important biological mediators that regulate 
      numerous cellular processes. New experimental evidence suggests that lncRNAs play 
      essential roles in liver development, normal liver physiology, fibrosis, and

AB  - Numerous studies have described the critical role played by microRNAs (miRNAs) in 
      cancer progression and the potential of these small non-coding RNAs for diagnostic 
      or therapeutic applications. However, the mechanisms responsible for the altered 
      expression of miRNAs in malignant cells remain poorly understood. Herein, via 
      epigenetic unmasking, we identified a group of miRNAs located in the imprinted delta 
      like non-canonical Notch ligand 1 (DLK1)-maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) locus that 
      were repressed in hepatic tumor cells. Notably, miR-493-5p epigenetic silencing was 
      correlated with hypermethylation of the MEG3 differentially regulated region (DMR) 
      in liver cancer cell lines and tumor tissues from patients. Experimental rescue of 
      miR-493-5p promoted an anti-cancer response by hindering hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) cell growth in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. We found that miR-493-5p 
      mediated part of its tumor-suppressor activity by abrogating overexpression of 
      insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and the IGF2-derived intronic oncomir miR-483-3p 
      in HCC cells characterized by IGF2 loss of imprinting (LOI). In summary, this study 
      describes an unknown miRNA-dependent regulatory mechanism between two distinct 
      imprinted loci and a possible therapeutic window for liver cancer patients 
      exhibiting IGF2-miR-483 LOI and amplification.

TI  - Aptamer-Functionalized Dendrimer Delivery of Plasmid-Encoding lncRNA MEG3 Enhances 
      Gene Therapy in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.
PG  - 10305-10320
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S282107 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The clinical management of patients with castration-resistant prostate 
      cancer (CRPC) is difficult. However, novel treatment methods are gradually being 
      introduced. Considering the adverse effects of traditional treatments, recent 
      studies have investigated gene therapy as a method to combat CRPC; but, the 
      application of long non-coding (lnc) RNA in gene therapy remains scarce, despite 
      their promise. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a system that can efficiently 
      deliver lncRNA for the treatment of CRPC. Here, we investigated the efficacy of a 
      delivery system by introducing the plasmid-encoding tumor suppressor lncRNA MEG3 
      (pMEG3) in CRPC cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An EpDT3 aptamer-linked 
      poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer targeting EpCAM was used to deliver pMEG3 in CRPC 
      cells. The PAMAM-PEG-EpDT3/pMEG3 nanoparticles (NPs) were tested using in vitro 
      cellular assays including cellular uptake, entry, and CCK-8 measurement, and tumor 
      growth inhibition, histological assessment, and safety evaluations in in vivo animal 
      models. RESULTS: The EpDT3 aptamer promoted endocytosis of PAMAM and 
      PAMAM-PEG-EpDT3/pMEG3 NPs in CRPC cells. PAMAM-PEG-EpDT3/pMEG3 NPs exhibited a 
      significant anti-CRPC effect, both in vivo and in vitro, when compared to that of 
      unfunctionalized PAMAM-PEG/pMEG3 NPs. CONCLUSION: PAMAM-PEG-EpDT3/pMEG3 NPs can 
      potentially improve gene therapy in CRPC cells.

LID - 598205
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poorly differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma and serous 
      adenocarcinoma represent an aggressive subtype of endometrial cancer (EC). 
      Programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1) was known to exhibit a tumor cell-intrinsic 
      function in mediating immune-independent tumor progression. However, the functional 
      relevance of tumor cell-intrinsic PD-L1 expression in aggressive EC cells and the 
      mechanisms regulating its expression remain unknown. METHODS: PD-L1 expression in 65 
      EC tissues and 18 normal endometrium samples was analyzed using immunohistochemical 
      staining. The effects of PD-L1 on aggressive EC cell growth, migration and invasion 
      were investigated by cell functional assays. Luciferase reporter assays were used to 
      reveal the microRNA-216a (miR-216a)-dependent mechanism modulating the expression of 
      PD-L1. RESULTS: Positive PD-L1 expression was identified in 84% of benign cases but 
      only in 12% of the EC samples, and the staining levels of PD-L1 in EC tissues were 
      significantly lower than those in the normal tissues. Higher PD-L1 expression 
      predicts favorable survival in EC. Ectopic expression of PD-L1 in aggressive EC 
      cells results in decreased cell proliferation and the loss of mesenchymal 
      phenotypes. Mechanistically, PD-L1 exerts the anti-tumor effects by downregulating 
      MCL-1 expression. We found that PD-L1 levels in aggressive EC cells are regulated by 
      miR-216a, which directly targets PD-L1. We further identified a mechanism whereby 
      the long non-coding RNA MEG3 represses the expression of miR-216a, thereby leading 
      to increased PD-L1 expression and significant inhibition of cell migration and 
      invasion. CONCLUSION: These results reveal an unappreciated tumor cell-intrinsic 
      role for PD-L1 as a tumor suppressor in aggressive EC cells, and identify MEG3 and 
      miR-216a as upstream regulators of PD-L1.

AB  - Breast cancer (BRCA) is the most leading cause of cancer worldwide. It is a 
      heterogeneous disease with at least five molecular subtypes including luminal A, 
      luminal B, basal-like, HER2-enriched, and normal-like. These five molecular subtypes 
      are usually stratified according to their mRNA profile patterns; however, ncRNAs are 
      increasingly being used for this purpose. Among the ncRNAs class, the long 
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are molecules with more than 200 nucleotides with 
      versatile regulatory roles; and high tissue-specific expression profiles. The 
      heterogeneity of BRCA can also be reflected regarding tumor microenvironment immune 
      cells composition, which can directly impact a patient's prognosis and therapy 
      response. Using BRCA immunogenomics data from a previous study, we propose here a 
      bioinformatics approach to include lncRNAs complexity in BRCA molecular and immune 
      subtype. RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) BRCA cohort was analyzed, 
      and signal-to-noise ratio metrics were applied to create these subtype-specific 
      signatures. Five immune-related signatures were generated with approximately ten 
      specific lncRNAs, which were then functionally analyzed using GSEA enrichment and 
      survival analysis. We highlighted here some lncRNAs in each subtype. LINC01871 is 
      related to immune response activation and favorable overall survival in basal-like 
      samples; EBLN3P is related to immune response suppression and progression in luminal 
      B, MEG3, XXYLT1-AS2, and LINC02613 were related with immune response activation in 
      luminal A, HER2-enriched and normal-like subtypes, respectively. In this way, we 
      emphasize the need to know better the role of lncRNAs as regulators of immune 
      response to provide new perspectives regarding diagnosis, prognosis and 
      therapeutical targets in BRCA molecular subtypes.

AB  - Recent research has found that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were involved in 
      various human cancers. However, the role of these lncRNAs in cervical cancer remains 
      unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the biological function of maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a cancer-related lncRNA, and its underlying mechanism in 
      cervical cancer. In this study, MEG3 expression of 108 patients' cervical cancer 
      tissues and adjacent normal tissues was detected by quantitative real-time PCR 
      analysis (qRT-PCR), and the functional effect of MEG3 was determined in vitro 
      assays. We observed that MEG3 was downregulated in cervical cancer tissues, compared 
      to the adjacent normal tissues, and was negatively related with FIGO stages, tumor 
      size, lymphatic metastasis, HR-HPV infection and the expression of homo sapiens 
      microRNA-21 (miR-21). Furthermore, we focused on the function and molecular 
      mechanism of MEG3, finding that overexpression of MEG3 reduced the level of 
      miR-21-5p expression, causing inhibition of proliferation and increased apoptosis in 
      cervical cancer cells. In summary, our findings indicate that MEG3 function as a 
      tumor suppressor by regulating miR-21-5p, resulting in the inhibition of tumor 
      growth in cervical cancer. As a result, this study improves our understanding of the 
      function of MEG3 in cervical cancer and will help to provide new potential target 
      sites for cervical cancer treatment.

PG  - 2183-2190
LID - 10.3892/ol.2020.11770 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MEG3 is a key biomarker and therapeutic target in lung 
      cancer; however, its underlying molecular mechanism in lung cancer progression 
      remains unclear. The present study demonstrated a novel regulatory axis in lung 
      cancer, lncRNA MEG3/dyskeratosis congenita 1 (DKC1), and further investigated the 
      effects and molecular mechanism of lncRNA MEG3/DKC1 in lung cancer. RT-qPCR and 
      western blot analysis were performed to determine gene and protein expression 
      levels. The RNA immunoprecipitation assay was performed to verify binding between 
      lncRNA MEG3 and DKC1. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to assess cell 
      apoptosis, while the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was performed to determine cell 
      viability. Transwell and wound healing assays were performed to assess cell invasion 
      and migration, respectively. Telomerase activity was measured using the quantitative 
      TeloTAGGG Telomerase PCR-ELISA kit. The results demonstrated that lncRNA MEG3 was 
      downregulated, while its binding protein, DKC1, was upregulated in lung cancer 
      cells. Furthermore, lncRNA MEG3 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion 
      and telomerase activity in A549 cells by downregulating DKC1. lncRNA MEG3 inhibited 
      non-small cell lung cancer progression by inhibiting telomere function, cell 
      proliferation, telomerase activity, cell migration and invasion via regulation of 
      the DKC1 protein expression. LncRNA MEG3/DKC1 was identified as a novel 
      dual-directional regulatory axis in the present study, acting as a promising target 
      for the treatment of lung cancer.

TI  - Anisomycin inhibits angiogenesis in ovarian cancer by attenuating the molecular 
      sponge effect of the lncRNA‑Meg3/miR‑421/PDGFRA axis.
PG  - 1296-1312
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2019.4887 [doi]
AB  - Angiogenesis has an important role in tumour cell growth and metastasis. Anisomycin 
      has been shown to inhibit tumour cell growth. However, whether anisomycin can 
      inhibit angiogenesis of tumours has not been reported. The present study 
      demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between tumour angiogenesis and 
      the number of CD44+/CD133+ serous human ovarian cancer stem cells (HuOCSCs). 
      Subsequently, it was confirmed that anisomycin significantly inhibited the 
      proliferation, invasion, tumorigenic ability and tumour angiogenesis of HuOCSCs. 
      Gene expression profiling by cDNA microarrays revealed that the expression levels of 
      vascular endothelial cell markers, platelet‑derived growth factors, Notch pathway 
      components and 27 tumour angiogenesis‑related genes were significantly decreased in 
      the anisomycin‑treated group compared with the control group. Further experiments 
      demonstrated that the expression levels of endogenous long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) 
      maternally expressed 3 (Meg3) were significantly decreased in anisomycin‑treated 
      HuOCSCs, whereas the expression levels of microRNA (miR)‑421 were significantly 
      increased. The results of luciferase reporter assays indicated that, when miR‑421 
      was overexpressed in cells, the luciferase activities of wild‑type platelet derived 
      growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) 3' untranslated region and Meg3 reporter plasmids 
      were significantly decreased. Overexpression of miR‑421 in HuOCSCs significantly 
      enhanced the anisomycin‑mediated inhibition of HuOCSC proliferation. Taken together, 
      the present results demonstrated that anisomycin inhibited the activation downstream 
      of the Notch1 pathway by attenuating the molecular sponge effect of the 
      lncRNA‑Meg3/miR‑421/PDGFRA axis, ultimately inhibiting angiogenesis, proliferation 
      and invasion in ovarian cancer cells.

TI  - Functional impact of the long non-coding RNA MEG3 deletion by CRISPR/Cas9 in the 
      human triple negative metastatic Hs578T cancer cell line.
PG  - 5941-5951
LID - 10.3892/ol.2019.10969 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve critical roles in regulating cellular 
      homeostasis, and their deregulated expression/activity is associated with neoplastic 
      transformation. The maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) has been extensively 
      described as a tumor suppressor gene in different types of cancer, including breast 
      cancer. Interestingly, using a panel of seven different breast cancer cell lines, 
      the present study revealed that MEG3 is highly expressed in the triple negative 
      metastatic human Hs578T breast cancer cell line, which is refractory to different 
      therapeutic approaches. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the 
      phenotypic impact of MEG3 deletion in this cell line. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, 
      complete knockout (KO) of MEG3 was achieved. Deletion was confirmed by genomic PCR 
      and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The MEG3_KO cell population displaying 
      the highest efficiency of genomic editing was selected for phenotypic in vitro 
      assays, including wound scratch and Transwell assays, flow cytometry and 
      immunofluorescence. The results demonstrated that MEG3 deletion increased cell 
      proliferation, anchorage-independent cell growth and cell motility, which was 
      consistent with its well-known tumor suppressor function. However, the present study 
      revealed that MEG3_KO also lead to decreased cell invasiveness ability, supporting 
      previous evidence that MEG3 modulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal inducing factors. 
      The present study demonstrated that deletion of MEG3 promoted an increase in 
      transforming growth factor β and N-cadherin protein levels and significant reduction 
      in matrix metallopeptidase 2, zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 and collagen type 
      III α1 chain gene expression levels. Additionally, MEG3_KO cells displayed 
      significant resistance to doxorubicin treatment, demonstrating the role of this 
      lncRNA in cancer cell survival by regulating apoptosis. The present study 
      highlighted the utility of CRISPR/Cas9 for anticancer studies of intergenic lncRNAs 
      and demonstrated that, although Hs578T cells express MEG3 at high levels, these 
      cells display mechanisms to escape the growth suppression effects of this lncRNA. 
      Notably, the detailed pathological mechanisms of MEG3 concerning tumor metastasis 
      remain to be elucidated prior to applying MEG3 expression/activation in future 
      therapeutic approaches for breast cancer treatment.

      development. LncRNA MEG3, a tumor suppressor, has been reported to play important 
      roles in some cancers, but the role of MEG3 in GBC remains largely unknown. The 
      purpose of the present study was to explore the role of MEG3 in proliferation and 
      invasion and the potential molecular mechanism in GBC. We found that MEG3 was 
      downregulated in GBC tissues and cells, and low expression of MEG3 was correlated 
      with poor prognostic outcomes in patients. Overexpression of MEG3 inhibited GBC cell 
      proliferation and invasion, induced cell apoptosis and decreased tumorigenicity in 
      nude mice. Moreover, we found that MEG3 was associated with EZH2 and attenuated EZH2 
      by promoting its ubiquitination. Furthermore, MEG3 executed its functions via EZH2 
      to regulate the downstream target gene LATS2. Taken together, these findings suggest 
      that MEG3 is an effective target for GBC therapy and may facilitate the development 
      of lncRNA-directed diagnostics and therapeutics against GBC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our previous study reported that MEG3 is an important tumor suppressor 
      gene that is inactivated in cervical cancer. However, the diagnostic and prognostic 
      values of MEG3, as well as the molecular mechanism of MEG3 inactivation in cervical 
      cancer, remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to further elucidate the role and 
      potential inactivation mechanism of MEG3 in cervical cancer. METHODS: ROC curve and 
      Cox regression analyses were used to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of 
      MEG3 in patients with cervical cancer. The methylation status of the MEG3 promoter 
      in cervical cancer tissue samples was tested using methylation-specific PCR. 
      Furthermore, we altered the methylation status of the MEG3 promoter in two cervical 
      cancer cell lines (HeLa and CaSki) using a DNA methylation transfer enzyme inhibitor 
      (5-Aza-CdR), to investigate whether promoter hypermethylation is a potential cause 
      of MEG3 inactivation. Finally, we used CCK-8 and colony formation assays to evaluate 
      the cell proliferation ability of HeLa and CaSki cells that had been treated with 
      5-aza-CdR, to investigate whether downregulation of MEG3 caused by promoter 
      hypermethylation had biological effects. RESULTS: ROC curve analysis indicated that 
      MEG3 status showed sufficient sensitivity and specificity for prediction of tumor 
      size and lymph node metastasis in patients with cervical cancer. In addition, our 
      follow-up data showed that low MEG3 expression was correlated with recurrence and 
      short overall survival. Moreover, hypermethylation of the MEG3 promoter was observed 
      in most cervical cancer tissue samples, and demethylation of the MEG3 promoter led 
      to re-expression of MEG3 and inhibited proliferation of HeLa and CaSki cells. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MEG3 is a powerful tool for diagnosis and prognosis of patients with 
      cervical cancer, and low expression of MEG3 is likely to be related to promoter 
      hypermethylation in cervical cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mounting evidence has elaborated the implication of long noncoding RNAs 
      (lncRNAs) in tumorigenesis of several cancers, including glioma. However, little was 
      known about the mechanism of lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in the 
      development and progression of glioma. This work is designed to explore the effect 
      of MEG3 on glioma progression and its possible mechanism. METHODS: Expressions of 
      lncRNA-MEG3 and SMARCB1 were detected in human glioblastoma U87 and U251 cell lines. 
      Gain and loss of function of MEG3 or/and miR-6088 was performed in U87 and U251 
      cells to observe its effect on cell proliferation and migration as well as on 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related markers. Luciferase reporter gene 
      assay was employed to inspect the interactions among MEG3, miR-6088, and SMARCB1. 
      RESULTS: MEG3 and SMARCB1 expressions were downregulated in glioma cells. 
      Transfection of pcDNA3.1-MEG3 or pcDNA3.1-SMARCB1 plasmids could clearly block cell 
      proliferation, migration, and EMT progression. MEG3 functions as a sponge for 
      miR-6088, while SMARCB1 is a downstream protein of miR-6088. Transfection of 
      miR-6088 mimic or si-SMARCB1 could obviously reverse the favorable effect of 
      pcDNA3.1-MEG3 on glioma progression. CONCLUSION: Collectively, the evidence in this 
      study indicated that MEG3 was downregulated in glioma cells and inhibited 
      proliferation and migration of glioma cells via regulating miR-6088/SMARCB1 axis.

TI  - Hypermethylation of lncRNA MEG3 impairs chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells.
PG  - e23369

LID - e23369
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemoresistance posed a barrier to successful treatment of breast cancer 
      (BC), and lncRNA MEG3 has been documented to implicate in BC development. However, 
      whether MEG3 methylation, which led to low MEG3 expression, was relevant to BC 
      progression and chemoresistance remained uncertain. METHODS: In the aggregate, 374 
      pairs of tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from 
      pathologically confirmed BC patients, and four BC cell lines, including MDA-MB-231, 
      Bcap-37, MCF-7, and SK-BR-3, were purchased. Moreover, methylation-specific 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was adopted to evaluate the methylation status of BC 
      tissues and cell lines, and chemo-tolerance of BC cell lines was assessed by 
      performing MTT assay. Concurrently, transwell assay and scratch assay were carried 
      out to estimate the migratory and invasive capability of BC cell lines. RESULTS: 
      Methylated MEG3, lowly expressed MEG3, large tumor size (≥2 cm), advanced TNM grade 
      and lymphatic metastasis were potentially symbolic of poor prognosis among BC 
      patients (P < .05). Besides, MDA-MB-231 cell line exhibited the strongest resistance 
      against paclitaxel, adriamycin, and vinorelbine (P < .05), while MCF-7 cell line 
      seemed more sensitive against these drugs than any other BC cell line (P < .05). 
      Furthermore, pcDNA3.1-MEG3 and 5-Aza-dC markedly sensitized MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 
      cell lines against the drug treatments (P < .05). Simultaneously, proliferation and 
      metastasis of the BC cell lines were slowed down under the force of pcDNA3.1-MEG3 
      and 5-Aza-dC (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Preventing methylation of MEG3 might matter in 
      lessening BC chemoresistance, owing to its hindering proliferation and metastasis of 
      BC cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Oral cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been considered as the key 
      cells that are implicated in tumor recurrence and metastasis. In recent years, great 
      attention has been paid to the significance of various non-coding RNAs due to their 
      regulatory roles in oral CSCs. Although the function of long non-coding RNA MEG3 in 
      various cancers has been investigated, its effects on the features of oral CSCs 
      remained to be determined. METHODS: The expression levels of MEG3 in tongue squamous 
      cell carcinomas and prognostic effect have been evaluated. We assessed the 
      expression of MEG3 in sphere cells (oral CSCs) using qRT-PCR. Secondary sphere 
      formation and invasion assays were conducted to evaluate the self-renewal and 
      metastatic abilities, respectively. Bioinformatics software and luciferase reporter 
      assay were used to predict and verify the relationship between MEG3 and miR-421. 
      RESULTS: MEG3 was downregulated in the tissues of oral cancer and associated with a 
      poor prognosis. In oral CSCs, the expression of MEG3 was repressed and 
      overexpression of MEG3 resulted in suppression of self-renewal and invasion 
      abilities. Luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-421 directly interacted with 
      MEG3, and our subsequent experiment demonstrated that elevation of miR-421 reversed 
      the MEG3-inhibited characteristics of oral CSCs. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest 
      that MEG3 can serve as a tumor suppressor in oral CSCs by impeding the action of 
      miR-421. Moreover, targeting MEG3-miR-421 axis has the potential to mitigate the 
      tumor recurrence and metastasis.

TI  - LncRNA Meg3 protects endothelial function by regulating the DNA damage response.
PG  - 1505-1522
LID - 10.1093/nar/gky1190 [doi]
AB  - The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating endothelial function 
      through the DNA damage response (DDR) remains poorly understood. In this study, we 
      demonstrate that lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (Meg3) interacts with the RNA 
      binding protein polypyrimidine tract binding protein 3 (PTBP3) to regulate gene 
      expression and endothelial function through p53 signaling ─ a major coordinator of 
      apoptosis and cell proliferation triggered by the DDR. Meg3 expression is induced in 
      endothelial cells (ECs) upon p53 activation. Meg3 silencing induces DNA damage, 
      activates p53 signaling, increases the expression of p53 target genes, promotes EC 
      apoptosis, and inhibits EC proliferation. Mechanistically, Meg3 silencing reduces 
      the interaction of p53 with Mdm2, induces p53 expression, and promotes the 
      association of p53 with the promoters of a subset of p53 target genes. PTBP3 
      silencing recapitulates the effects of Meg3 deficiency on the expression of p53 
      target genes, EC apoptosis and proliferation. The Meg3-dependent association of 
      PTBP3 with the promoters of p53 target genes suggests that Meg3 and PTBP3 restrain 
      p53 activation. Our studies reveal a novel role of Meg3 and PTBP3 in regulating p53 
      signaling and endothelial function, which may serve as novel targets for therapies 
      to restore endothelial homeostasis.

TI  - Hypermethylated long noncoding RNA MEG3 promotes the progression of gastric cancer.
PG  - 8139-8155
LID - 10.18632/aging.102309 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to explore the expression and degree of methylation of lncRNA MEG3 
      in gastric cancer tissues and to analyze its effect on the migration and 
      proliferation of gastric cancer patients and the mechanism by which this occurs. The 
      targeting relationship between MEG3, miR-181a-5p and ATP4B was detected through 
      molecular biology experiments. Wound healing, transwell, colony formation and flow 
      cytometry assays were used to analyze the effects of lncRNA MEG3 and methylation on 
      tumor cell migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, a tumor 
      xenotransplantation model was established to study the influence of MEG3 on tumor 
      growth in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis showed that lncRNA MEG3 and ATP4B were 
      downregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. Bioinformatics 
      predicted that ATP4B might be regulated by targeting miR-181a-5p. The overexpression 
      of MEG3 and the application of 5-Aza treatment inhibited the migration, invasion and 
      proliferation of MGC-803 cells and promoted apoptosis. In gastric cancer tissues, 
      MEG3 is hypermethylated to decrease expression. Once the expression of MEG3 is 
      restored or methylation is inhibited, tumor growth can be inhibited both in vivo and 
      in vitro. This finding could be utilized as a clinical reference for gastric cancer 
      treatment in the future.

AB  - Histone methylation is implicated in a number of biological and pathological 
      processes, including cancer development. In this study, we investigated the 
      molecular mechanism for the recruitment of Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) and 
      its accessory component, JARID2, to chromatin, which regulates methylation of lysine 
      27 of histone H3 (H3K27), during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer 
      cells. The expression of MEG3 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), which could interact with 
      JARID2, was clearly increased during transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced 
      EMT of human lung cancer cell lines. Knockdown of MEG3 inhibited TGF-β-mediated 
      changes in cell morphology and cell motility characteristic of EMT and counteracted 
      TGF-β-dependent changes in the expression of EMT-related genes such as CDH1, ZEB 
      family, and the microRNA-200 family. Overexpression of MEG3 influenced the 
      expression of these genes and enhanced the effects of TGF-β in their expressions. 
      Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that MEG3 regulated the recruitment of 
      JARID2 and EZH2 and histone H3 methylation on the regulatory regions of CDH1 and 
      microRNA-200 family genes for transcriptional repression. RNA immunoprecipitation 
      and chromatin isolation by RNA purification assays indicated that MEG3 could 
      associate with JARID2 and the regulatory regions of target genes to recruit the 
      complex. This study demonstrated a crucial role of MEG3 lncRNA in the epigenetic 
      regulation of the EMT process in lung cancer cells.

      colorectal cancer in Chinese.
PG  - 19054-9
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.7764 [doi]
AB  - Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), is involved in 
      cancer development and metastasis. The objective of the present study was to 
      evaluate whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MEG3 could be 
      related with colorectal cancer risk in Chinese. We genotyped six tagSNPs of MEG3 in 
      a colorectal cancer case-control study including 518 cases and 527 control subjects. 
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to calculate adjusted odds 
      ratios (ORs). We found that MEG3 rs7158663 AA genotype, but not GA genotype, had 
      significant increased colorectal cancer risk, compared with GG genotype (OR = 1.96 
      and P = 0.006 for AA versus GG, and OR = 1.20 and P = 0.171 for GA versus GG). 
      Further stratified analysis indicated that the increased risk was significantly 
      correlated with individuals with age ≤ 60 and family history of cancer. However, 
      there was no significant association between rs7158663 and colorectal tumor site and 
      stage (P = 0.842 for tumor site, and P = 0.601 for tumor stage). These results 
      demonstrate that genetic variants in MEG3 may contribute to the development and risk 
      of colorectal cancer. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.

LID - 10.3892/etm.2020.8414 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the application value of lncRNA MEG3 in 
      lung cancer. From March 2017 to March 2019, 119 asthma patients and 125 healthy 
      people undergoing physical examination in the same period were selected as the 
      research objects. The levels of lncRNA MEG3 in the peripheral blood of the two 
      groups were compared, and the predictive value of MEG3 for asthma as well as the 
      differences in different inflammatory phenotypes were analyzed. The expression of 
      MEG3 was low in asthma patients (P<0.050), the diagnostic sensitivity and 
      specificity for asthma were 79.83 and 66.40%, respectively (P<0.001), it was the 
      lowest in mixed granulocytic asthma (P<0.050) and was negatively correlated with the 
      course of disease (r=-0.666, P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that 
      course of disease, inflammatory phenotype and MEG3 were independent factors 
      affecting recurrence of asthma (P<0.050). MEG3 was low expressed in asthma and had 
      good predictive value for it; in mixed granulocytic asthma, its expression was the 
      lowest and the course of disease was closely related. It might be the key to the 
      diagnosis and treatment of asthma in the future.

TI  - Long Non-Coding RNA MEG3 Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Induces Apoptosis in 
      Prostate Cancer.
PG  - 2209-20
LID - 10.1159/000438577 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in diverse 
      biological processes, such as cell growth, apoptosis and migration. Although 
      downregulation of lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) has been identified in 
      several cancers, little is known about its role in prostate cancer progression. The 
      aim of this study was to detect MEG3 expression in clinical prostate cancer tissues, 
      investigate its biological functions in the development of prostate cancer and the 
      underlying mechanism. METHODS: MEG3 expression levels were detected by qRT-PCR in 
      both tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 21 prostate cancer patients. 
      The effects of MEG3 on PC3 and DU145 cells were assessed by MTT assay, colony 
      formation assay, western blot and flow cytometry. Transfected PC3 cells were 
      transplanted into nude mice, and the tumor growth curves were determined. RESULTS: 
      MEG3 decreased significantly in prostate cancer tissues relative to adjacent normal 
      tissues. MEG3 inhibited intrinsic cell survival pathway in vitro and in vivo by 
      reducing the protein expression of Bcl-2, enhancing Bax and activating caspase 3. We 
      further demonstrated that MEG3 inhibited the expression of cell cycle regulatory 
      protein Cyclin D1 and induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study presents an important role of MEG3 in the molecular etiology of prostate 
      cancer and implicates the potential application of MEG3 in prostate cancer therapy.

TI  - LncRNA MEG3 Regulates Imatinib Resistance in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia via 
      Suppressing MicroRNA-21.
PG  - 490-496
LID - 10.4062/biomolther.2016.162 [doi]
AB  - Imatinib resistance has become a major clinical problem for chronic myeloid 
      leukemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of MEG3, a 
      lncRNA, in imatinib resistance and demonstrate its underlying mechanisms. RNAs were 
      extracted from CML patients' peripheral blood cells and human leukemic K562 cells, 
      and the expression of MEG3 was measured by RT-qPCR. Cell proliferation and cell 
      apoptosis were evaluated. Western blotting was used to measure the protein 
      expression of several multidrug resistant transporters. Luciferase reporter assay 
      was performed to determine the binding between MEG3 and miR-21. Our results showed 
      that MEG3 was significantly decreased in imatinib-resistant CML patients and 
      imatinib-resistant K562 cells. Overexpression of MEG3 in imatinib-resistant K562 
      cells markedly decreased cell proliferation, increased cell apoptosis, reversed 
      imatinib resistance, and reduced the expression of MRP1, MDR1, and ABCG2. 
      Interestingly, MEG3 binds to miR-21. MEG3 and miR-21 were negatively correlated in 
      CML patients. In addition, miR-21 mimics reversed the phenotype of 
      MEG3-overexpression in imatinib-resistant K562 cells. Taken together, MEG3 is 
      involved in imatinib resistance in CML and possibly contributes to imatinib 
      resistance through regulating miR-21, and subsequent cell proliferation, apoptosis 
      and expression of multidrug resistant transporters.

TI  - LncRNAs: Novel Biomarkers for Pancreatic Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/biom11111665 [doi]
LID - 1665
AB  - Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly neoplasms and the seventh major cause of 
      cancer-related deaths among both males and females. This cancer has a poor prognosis 
      due to the lack of appropriate methods for early detection of cancer. Long 
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recently found to influence the progression and 
      initiation of pancreatic cancer. MACC1-AS1, LINC00976, LINC00462, LINC01559, 
      HOXA-AS2, LINC00152, TP73-AS1, XIST, SNHG12, LUCAT1, and UCA1 are among the 
      oncogenic lncRNAs in pancreatic cancer. On the other hand, LINC01111, LINC01963, 
      DGCR5, MEG3, GAS5, and LINC00261 are among tumor suppressor lncRNAs in this tissue. 
      In the current review, we summarize the roles of these two classes of lncRNAs in 
      pancreatic cancer and discuss their potential as attractive diagnostic and 
      prognostic biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. We also identified that the low 
      expression of MEG3, LINC01963, and LINC00261 and the high expression of MACC1-AS1, 
      LINC00462, LINC01559, and UCA1 were significantly correlated with worse survival in 
      pancreatic cancer patients. Further research on these lncRNAs will provide new clues 
      that could potentially improve the early diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and 
      personalized treatments of patients with pancreatic cancer.

TI  - lncRNA MEG3 inhibits pituitary tumor development by participating in cell 
      proliferation, apoptosis and EMT processes.
LID - 40 [pii]
LID - 10.3892/or.2021.7991 [doi]
AB  - Pituitary tumors do not pose a threat to life but can cause visual disturbances and 
      serious clinical syndromes, such as infertility and metabolic syndrome. Therefore, 
      screening of key genes involved in the occurrence and development of pituitary 
      tumors can provide new targets for the treatment of pituitary tumors. The aim of the 
      present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of long non‑coding (lnc.) 
      RNA maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) in cell proliferation, apoptosis and 
      epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes of pituitary tumor. Tissue samples 
      were obtained from 34 patients who underwent surgical treatment of pituitary tumors. 
      Pituitary tumor cells (GH3 and MMQ) were transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)‑MEG3, short 
      hairpin (sh)MEG3, microRNA (miR)‑23‑3p inhibitor or their controls using 
      Lipofectamine(®) 2000. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blot 
      analyses were used to detect the levels of MEG3, miR‑23b‑3p and FOXO4, as well as 
      proliferation‑, apoptosis‑ and EMT‑associated genes and proteins. Cell Counting 
      Kit‑8 and flow cytometry assays were performed to detect proliferation and 
      apoptosis, and Transwell assay was undertaken to assess invasion and migration. 
      Luciferase reporter and RNA pulldown assays were performed to verify the binding 
      between lncRNA MEG3, miR‑23b‑3p and FOXO4. Pearson's correlation analysis was used 
      to analyze the correlation between expression levels of MEG3, miR‑23b‑3p and FOXO4. 
      lncRNA MEG3 was expressed at lower levels in pituitary tumor tissues and cells. 
      Overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 inhibited proliferation, invasion and migration and 
      accelerated apoptosis of pituitary tumor cells. lncRNA MEG3 negatively regulated 
      miR‑23b‑3p expression levels, while miR‑23b‑3p negatively regulated FOXO4 expression 
      levels. Overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 inhibited the EMT process in pituitary tumor 
      cells. miR‑23‑3p inhibitor rescued the effect of shMEG3 on proliferation, invasion, 
      migration, apoptosis and the EMT process in pituitary tumor cells. lncRNA MEG3 
      inhibited pituitary tumor development by participating in cell proliferation, 
      apoptosis and the EMT process, which may present a novel target for pituitary tumor 
      treatment.

TI  - Associations between lncRNA MEG3 polymorphisms and neuroblastoma risk in Chinese 
      children.
PG  - 481-491
LID - 10.18632/aging.101406 [doi]
AB  - Neuroblastoma is the third most common childhood cancer after leukemias and cancer 
      of the central nervous system. Long noncoding RNA MEG3 polymorphisms have been shown 
      to confer cancer susceptibility; however, their roles in the genetic predisposition 
      to neuroblastoma remain unclarified. To answer this question, we genotyped two MEG3 
      polymorphisms, rs7158663 G>A and rs4081134 G>A, in 392 neuroblastoma children and 
      783 controls by TaqMan method. The results showed that neither single locus nor the 
      combination analysis supported an association between MEG3 polymorphism and 
      neuroblastoma risk. Interestingly, we found that subjects carrying rs4081134 AG/AA 
      genotypes significantly tended to develop neuroblastoma among subgroups with age >18 
      month (adjusted OR=1.36, 95% CI=1.01-1.84) and clinical stage III+IV disease 
      (adjusted OR=1.47, 95% CI=1.08-1.99), when compared with reference group. In the 
      combined analysis of MEG3 polymorphisms, we found that carriers of 2 risk genotypes 
      were more likely to have higher risk of developing neuroblastoma than those with 0-1 
      risk genotype among children more than 18 months of age (adjusted OR=1.36, 95% 
      CI=1.01-1.84, P=0.042), and with clinical stages III+IV disease (adjusted OR=1.47, 
      95% CI=1.08-2.00, P=0.014). Our data suggest MEG3 as a weak-effect neuroblastoma 
      susceptibility gene. Well-designed studies with large sample studies are needed to 
      further validate this finding.

AB  - The long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is frequently 
      dysregulated in human cancers; however, its roles in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
      development are largely unknown. Here, we reported that MEG3 was down-regulated in 
      CRC tissues and CRC patients with lower MEG3 showed poorer overall survival and 
      disease-free survival than those with higher MEG3 level. MEG3 over-expression 
      represses CRC cells proliferation and migration in vivo and in vitro, while MEG3 
      knockdown leads to the enhanced proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells. In CRC 
      cells, MEG3 over-expression is related to decreased Clusterin mRNA and the 
      corresponding protein levels, and it also directly binds to Clusterin protein 
      through its 732-1174 region. In further, Clusterin over-expression rescues the 
      compromised abilities of proliferation and metastasis induced by MEG3 
      over-expression, suggesting that MEG3 inhibits the CRC progression through 
      regulating the Clusterin activities. Additionally, we found that 1α,25-(OH)(2)D and 
      vitamin D receptor (VDR) stimulate MEG3 expression in CRC cells through directly 
      binding to its promoter. These results suggested that MEG3 functions as a tumor 
      suppressor in CRC via regulating the Clusterin activities and may underlie the 
      anticancer activities of vitamin D on CRC cells. The VDR/MEG3/Clusterin signaling 
      pathway may serve as potential therapeutic targets and prognosis biomarkers for CRC 
      patients in future.

TI  - Pan-Cancer Analysis of lncRNA Regulation Supports Their Targeting of Cancer Genes in

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are commonly dysregulated in tumors, but only a 
      handful are known to play pathophysiological roles in cancer. We inferred lncRNAs 
      that dysregulate cancer pathways, oncogenes, and tumor suppressors (cancer genes) by 
      modeling their effects on the activity of transcription factors, RNA-binding 
      proteins, and microRNAs in 5,185 TCGA tumors and 1,019 ENCODE assays. Our 
      predictions included hundreds of candidate onco- and tumor-suppressor lncRNAs 
      (cancer lncRNAs) whose somatic alterations account for the dysregulation of dozens 
      of cancer genes and pathways in each of 14 tumor contexts. To demonstrate proof of 
      concept, we showed that perturbations targeting OIP5-AS1 (an inferred tumor 
      suppressor) and TUG1 and WT1-AS (inferred onco-lncRNAs) dysregulated cancer genes 
      and altered proliferation of breast and gynecologic cancer cells. Our analysis 
      indicates that, although most lncRNAs are dysregulated in a tumor-specific manner, 
      some, including OIP5-AS1, TUG1, NEAT1, MEG3, and TSIX, synergistically dysregulate 
      cancer pathways in multiple tumor contexts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is associated with human 
      carcinogenesis. The aim of the study is to explore the biological functions of MEG3 
      expression in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      QRT-PCR analysis was performed to assess the expression of MEG3 in 35 pairs of LSCC 
      tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Cell proliferation, cell migration, and 
      cell invasion capacities were determined by CCK8 assay and transwell assay in Hep-2 
      cell. QRT-PCR and Western blot analysis were applied to detect the relative 
      expression of Twist1, E-cadherin and Vimentin in Hep-2 cells. RESULTS: In the study, 
      our results showed that MEG3 expression was significantly lower in tumor tissues 
      compared with that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Lower MEG3 expression was 
      significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage of 
      patients. Knockdown of MEG3 significantly promotes cell proliferation, cell 
      migration, cell invasion and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) process by 
      upregulating Twist1 and Vimentin expression and reducing E-cadherin expression in 
      Hep-2 cell. Conversely, upregulation of MEG3 had the inhibiting effects in Hep-2 
      cell. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that MEG3 may serve as a novel 
      potentially therapeutic target for LSCC treatment.

TI  - Identifying and characterizing lincRNA genomic clusters reveals its cooperative 
      functions in human cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence has revealed that some long intergenic non-coding RNAs 
      (lincRNAs) are likely to form clusters on the same chromosome, and lincRNA genomic 
      clusters might play critical roles in the pathophysiological mechanism. However, the 
      comprehensive investigation of lincRNA clustering is rarely studied, particularly 
      the characterization of their functional significance across different cancer types. 
      METHODS: In this study, we firstly constructed a computational method basing a 
      sliding window approach for systematically identifying lincRNA genomic clusters. We 
      then dissected these lincRNA genomic clusters to identify common characteristics in 
      cooperative expression, conservation among divergent species, targeted miRNAs, and 
      CNV frequency. Next, we performed comprehensive analyses in differentially-expressed 
      patterns and overall survival outcomes for patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
      (TCGA) and The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) across multiple cancer types. 
      Finally, we explored the underlying mechanisms of lincRNA genomic clusters by 
      functional enrichment analysis, pathway analysis, and drug-target interaction. 
      RESULTS: We identified lincRNA genomic clusters according to the algorithm. 
      Clustering lincRNAs tended to be co-expressed, highly conserved, targeted by more 
      miRNAs, and with similar deletion and duplication frequency, suggesting that lincRNA 
      genomic clusters may exert their effects by acting in combination. We further 
      systematically explored conserved and cancer-specific lincRNA genomic clusters, 
      indicating they were involved in some important mechanisms of disease occurrence 
      through diverse approaches. Furthermore, lincRNA genomic clusters can serve as 
      biomarkers with potential clinical significance and involve in specific pathological 
      processes in the development of cancer. Moreover, a lincRNA genomic cluster named 
      Cluster127 in DLK1-DIO3 imprinted locus was discovered, which contained MEG3, MEG8, 
      MEG9, MIR381HG, LINC02285, AL132709.5, and AL132709.1. Further analysis indicated 
      that Cluster127 may have the potential for predicting prognosis in cancer and could 
      play their roles by participating in the regulation of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Clarification of the lincRNA genomic clusters specific roles in human 
      cancers could be beneficial for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of 
      different cancer types.

AB  - Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3) is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that coordinates 
      a diverse array of cellular processes requiring epigenetic regulation of genes and 
      interactions with key signaling proteins and by acting as a competitive endogenous 
      (ce)RNA. Epigenetic modifications driven by in utero nutrition affect MEG3 
      expression and its role in the development of multiple metabolic disorders. This 
      review examines how epigenetic modification of MEG3 expression can confer 
      adaptedness to different metabolic environments. To this end, we discuss how 
      nutritional status that leads to an increase of MEG3 expression can protect against 
      cancer and metabolic dysfunctions, while interventions that promote MEG3 
      downregulation minimize the pleiotropic costs associated with its expression. 
      Lastly, we identify research directions that would further shed light on the role of 
      MEG3 in metabolic regulation and in functional imprinted gene networks. This article 
      is part of a Special Issue entitled: ncRNA in control of gene expression edited by

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs nowadays emerge as important biomarkers or 
      potential therapeutic targets discussed in human cancers. Among them, maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is known to be decreased in a variety of malignancies, and 
      this affects tumor cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the expression of MEG3 
      in normal cervical epithelium, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and cervical 
      squamous cell carcinoma tissues. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies were 
      carried out to determine the effect of MEG3 on cell survival, migration, and 
      invasion, which was evaluated by CCK-8 assay, wound healing assay, and transwell 
      assays. mRNA and protein expression of Rac1 were finally determined by quantitative 
      real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. In addition, rescue experiments were 
      performed by overexpression of Rac1. RESULTS: The expression of MEG3 was 
      downregulated in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and squamous cell carcinoma 
      tissues. Forced expression of MEG3 led to reduced abilities of cell survival. 
      Overexpression of MEG3 also inhibited cell migration and invasion in vitro. Cell 
      proliferation marker and EMT markers were changed consistently with the phenotype. 
      In addition, Rac1 was inhibited by MEG3 overexpression at both transcriptional and 
      translational levels. Also, Rac1 could rescue the phenotype caused by long 
      non-coding RNA MEG3. And, it negatively correlated with MEG3 expression in cervical 
      cancer (CC) tissues and cell lines. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that MEG3 
      could negatively regulate CC cell survival, migration, and invasion. It might serve 
      as an important target for CC treatment.

AB  - Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) encodes an lncRNA which is suggested to function 
      as a tumor suppressor and has been showed to involve in a variety of cancers. 
      Herein, our findings demonstrate that MEG3 inhibits the malignant progression of 
      liver cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MEG3 promotes the 
      expression and maturition of miR122 which targets PKM2. Therefore, MEG3 decreases 
      the expression and nuclear location of PKM2 dependent on miR122. Furthermore, MEG3 
      also inhibits CyclinD1 and C-Myc via PKM2 in liver cancer cells. On the other hand, 
      MEG3 promotes β-catenin degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome system dependent on 
      PTEN. Strikingly, MEG3 inhibits β-catenin activity through PKM2 reduction and PTEN 
      increase. Significantly, we also found that excessive β-catenin abrogated the effect 
      of MEG3 in liver cancer. In conclusion, our study for the first time demonstrates 
      that MEG3 acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the activity of the 
      PKM2 and β-catenin signaling pathway in hepatocarcinogenesis and could provide 
      potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of liver cancer.

TI  - Restoration of miRNA-148a in pancreatic cancer reduces invasion and metastasis by 
      inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via downregulating maternally 
      expressed gene-3.

AB  - Various microRNAs (miRNA) have been recognized potential novel tumor markers and 
      have a critical role in cancer development and progression. Recently, methylation of 
      miRNA-148a was identified as a crucial biochemical process in the progression of 
      cancer. However, its potential role and in pancreatic cancer as well as the 
      underlying mechanisms have remained largely elusive. The present study investigated 
      the potential antitumor effect of miR-148a as well as its impact on invasion and 
      metastasis in pancreatic cancer. It was found that the expression of miRNA-148a and 
      the potential predictive biomarker maternally expressed gene-3 (MEG-3) were 
      obviously decreased in human pancreatic cancer tissues compared with those in 
      adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Furthermore, miR-148a was found to be downregulated 
      in pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with normal pancreatic cells through 
      promoter methylation. An MTT assay and a clonogenic assay demonstrated that 
      restoration of miRNA-148a inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of 
      pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, miR-148a transduction led to the upregulation 
      of MEG-3 expression and promoted apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. Western blot 
      analysis revealed that transduction of miR-148a markedly decreased the expression 
      levels of C-myc, cyclin D1 and β-catenin in pancreatic cancer cells. Methylation of 
      miR-148a not only decreased the endogenous β-catenin levels but also inhibited the 
      nuclear translocation of β-catenin to delay cell cycle progression. Furthermore, 
      ectopic miR-148a methylation inhibited pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion 
      via causing an upregulation of MEG-3 expression. Most importantly, ectopic 
      overexpression of miR-148a in pancreatic cancer cells inhibited tumor formation in 
      an animal experiment. Taken together, miR-148a methylation is a crucial regulatory 
      process to inhibit the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, and 
      transduction of miR-148a suppressed the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells 
      through negative regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The findings of 
      the present study suggested that miRNA-148a acts as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic 
      cancer and may contribute to the development of novel treatments for pancreatic 
      cancer.

AB  - Methylation alterations of specific genes have recently been identified as 
      diagnostic biomarkers for human cancers. Although MEG3 has been proved to be a tumor 
      suppressor in cervical cancer according to our previous study, the diagnostic value 
      of MEG3 methylation in plasma is still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study is 
      to identify a novel epigenetic biomarker for cervical cancer. In the current study, 
      the level of MEG3 methylation was evaluated using methylation-specific polymerase 
      chain reaction. The results showed that the level of MEG3 methylation was 
      significantly higher in cervical cancer tissues and patients' plasmas than those in 
      adjacent normal tissues and plasmas of healthy participants respectively. Moreover, 
      the accuracy was good enough for MEG3 methylation in plasma to discriminate CIN III 
      patients from healthy participants. In addition, MEG3 methylation in plasma also has 
      high discriminating power to predict HR-HPV infection and lymph node metastasis. 
      Furthermore, hypermethylation of MEG3 in plasma was associated with worse 
      recurrence-free and overall survival in cervical cancer patients. In conclusions, 
      MEG3 methylation in plasma can serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for 
      cervical cancer, providing useful information for clinical management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) plays an important role in cervical cancer 
      development, but its exact role remains unclear. Here, we explored the specific 
      regulatory mechanism of MEG3 and its downstream proteins in cervical cancer cells. 
      METHODS: The effect of MEG3 on tumor formation ability of cervical cancer cells was 
      determined in nude mice. The direct binding of MEG3 to phosphorylated signal 
      transducer and activator of transcription 3 (P-STAT3) was detected by RNA pull-down 
      and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Cycloheximide (CHX)-chase 
      and ubiquitination assays were performed to determine the regulatory effect of MEG3 
      on P-STAT3 ubiquitination. Clone formation assay and flow cytometry were used to 
      evaluate the effect of the MEG3-STAT3 regulatory axis on cell proliferation and 
      apoptosis. RESULTS: In vivo tumor formation experiments showed that MEG3 inhibited 
      the tumor formation ability of cervical cancer cells. RNA pull-down and RIP assays 
      demonstrated that MEG3 bound directly to P-STAT3 protein. CHX-chase and 
      ubiquitination assay results showed that MEG3 promoted P-STAT3 degradation via 
      ubiquitination. Clone formation assay and flow cytometry analysis results revealed 
      that the inhibitory effect of MEG3 on P-STAT3 promoted apoptosis and inhibited 
      proliferation of cervical cancer cells. CONCLUSION: MEG3 binds to P-STAT3 in 
      cervical cancer cells, resulting in P-STAT3 ubiquitination and degradation and 
      apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of tumor cells. The in-depth elaboration 
      of the MEG3-STAT3 regulatory axis in cervical cancer may clarify the mechanism of 
      action of MEG3 and provide new ideas for cervical cancer treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of long non-coding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) 
      maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) on proliferation and apoptosis of gallbladder 
      cancer (GBC) cells and its molecular mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The relative 
      expression level of lncRNA MEG3 in GBC cell lines was detected via quantitative 
      Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The lncRNA MEG3 
      expression plasmids were constructed, the cell proliferation ability was detected 
      via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and colony formation assay, and the apoptosis 
      was detected via flow cytometry. The effects of lncRNA MEG3 expression on 
      endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related proteins were determined using Western 
      blotting, and the changes in nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) protein in the nucleus were 
      determined after overexpression of lncRNA MEG3. RESULTS: The expression of lncRNA 
      MEG3 in three kinds of GBC cell lines was lower than that in human immortalized 
      normal biliary epithelial cells (p<0.05). The results of CCK-8 assay and colony 
      formation assay showed that overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 significantly reduced the 
      proliferation rate and colony formation ability of GBC-SD cells compared with 
      negative control (NC) group (p<0.05, p<0.05). According to the results of flow 
      cytometry, the apoptosis rate was higher in lncRNA MEG63 overexpression group 
      compared with that in NC group (p<0.05). Moreover, the ERS-related proteins (MANF, 
      GRP78, and caspase-3) were remarkably upregulated in lncRNA MEG63 overexpression 
      group compared with those in NC group, indicating that ERS is activated by lncRNA 
      MEG63 overexpression. The NF-κB signal in GBC cells was activated by lncRNA MEG3. 
      CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA MEG3 activates the NF-κB signal in GBC cells to affect the 
      proliferation and apoptosis of GBC cells.

TI  - Impact of DLK1-DIO3 imprinted cluster hypomethylation in smoker patients with lung 
      cancer.

AB  - DNA methylation is important for gene expression and genome stability, and its 
      disruption is thought to play a key role in the initiation and progression of cancer 
      and other diseases. The DLK1-DIO3 cluster has been shown to be imprinted in humans, 
      and some of its components are relevant to diverse pathological processes. The 
      purpose of this study was to assess the methylation patterns of the DLK1-DIO3 
      cluster in patients with lung cancer to study its relevance in the pathogenesis of 
      this disease. We found a characteristic methylation pattern of this cluster in 
      smoking associated lung cancer, as compared to normal lung tissue. This methylation 
      profile is not patent however in lung cancer of never smokers nor in lung tissue of 
      COPD patients. We found 3 deregulated protein-coding genes at this locus: one was 
      hypermethylated (DIO3) and two were hypomethylated (DLK1 and RTL1). Statistically 
      significant differences were also detected in two different families of SNORDs, two 
      miRNA clusters and four lncRNAs (MEG3, MEG8, MEG9 and LINC00524). These findings 
      were validated using data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database. We have then 
      showed an inverse correlation between DNA methylation and expression levels in 5 
      randomly selected genes. Several targets of miRNAs included in the DLK1-DIO3 cluster 
      have been experimentally verified as tumor suppressors. All of these results suggest 
      that the dysmethylation of the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 cluster could have a relevant 
      role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer in current and former smokers and may be 
      used for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes.

TI  - MEG3 can affect the proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells through 
      regulating miR-376/PRKD1 axis.
PG  - 5740-5751
AB  - The down-regulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MEG3 has been observed in 
      various cancers; nonetheless, underlying mechanisms are still unclear. The current 
      research work aims at exploring the roles of MEG3 in the pathogenesis of CRC and the 
      associated mechanism. We observed that MEG3 was significantly down-regulated in both 
      CRC tumor tissue and cell lines; also, the transient over-expression of MEG3 in CRC 
      cell line SW480 and LoVo inhibited the proliferation and the migration and clone 
      formation capability of cells; on the other hand, the knockdown of MEG3 has revealed 
      opposite effects. Eventually, we figured it out that target miR-376 directly 
      targeted both MEG3 and PRDK1 in SW480 and LoVo cells. To conclude, as our findings 
      proved, MEG3 is likely to act as a tumor suppressor in the pathogenesis of CRC by 
      means of the regulation of the miR-376/PRDK1 signal axis, suggesting that MEG3 has 
      the potential to become a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC.

TI  - Hypermethylation of MEG3 promoter correlates with inactivation of MEG3 and poor 
      prognosis in patients with retinoblastoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In our previous study, we revealed that MEG3 was a tumor suppressor gene 
      in retinoblastoma and inhibited proliferation of retinoblastoma cells by regulating 
      the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Here, we further explored the mechanism 
      of MEG3 inactivation in retinoblastoma. METHODS: MSP and qRT-PCR were performed to 
      detect the methylation status of MEG3 promoter and levels of MEG3 expression, 
      respective. To further explore relationship between MEG3 expression and epigenetic 
      modifications, 5-Aza-CdR was used to interfere with DNA methylation. In addition, we 
      evaluated proliferation, apoptosis and the expression of β-catenin via CCK-8, flow 
      cytometric analysis and western blot analysis, respective. RESULTS: Hypermethylation 
      of MEG3 promoter was observed more frequently in retinoblastoma tissues and was 
      highly associated with low MEG3 expression and poor survival of retinoblastoma 
      patients. We also provided evidence demonstrating that hypermethylation of MEG3 
      promoter depressed MEG3 expression, promoted proliferation, inhibited apoptosis and 
      increased β-catenin expression of retinoblastoma cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      present study indicates that promoter silencing by hypermethylation may account for 
      the loss of MEG3 expression and predict poor prognosis.

TI  - LncRNA MEG3 suppressed the progression of ovarian cancer via sponging miR-30e-3p and 
      regulating LAMA4 expression.

LID - 181
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OC) is a common female reproductive malignancy with a 
      high mortality rate. Although LAMA4 was observed to be downregulated in OC cells, 
      its mechanism in regulating OC metastasis is still unknown. This study aimed to 
      investigate the effect of LAMA4 and its mechanism on OC. METHODS: To achieve this 
      aim, a microarray analysis was performed to screen out the key genes involved in OC 
      pathogenesis. Western-blot and qRT-PCR assays were also carried out to detect 
      protein and mRNA expressions, respectively. A luciferase reporter assay was further 
      used to confirm the direct interaction of miR-30e-3p with MEG3, and the direct 
      interaction of miR-30e-3p with LAMA4 mRNA. Cytological experiments (CCK8, colony 
      formation assay, wound-healing assay etc.) were then performed to explore the roles 
      of miR-30e-3p, MEG3, and LAMA4 in OC cells. RESULTS: After carrying out microarray 
      analysis, LAMA4 was confirmed as a key gene associated with OC pathogenesis. 
      Research results proved that miR-30e-3p was markedly upregulated, while MEG3 and 
      LAMA4 were noticeably downregulated in OC tissues and cells. The overexpression of 
      LAMA4 significantly impaired the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells. 
      However, the upregulation of MEG3 increased the expression of LAMA4 by sponging 
      miR-30e-3p, which alleviated the malignancy of OC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Observations 
      showed that forced LAMA4 overexpression could inhibit OC progression, which was 
      regulated by MEG3 via sponging miR-30e-3p. The findings of this research could 
      provide new insights into the mechanism by which MEG3 and LAMA4 exert their 
      anti-oncogenic roles in OC progression.Trial registration Not applicable.

TI  - The Dysregulation of the DLK1-MEG3 Locus in Islets From Patients With Type 2 
      Diabetes Is Mimicked by Targeted Epimutation of Its Promoter With TALE-DNMT 
      Constructs.
PG  - 1807-1815
LID - 10.2337/db17-0682 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by the inability of the 
      insulin-producing β-cells to overcome insulin resistance. We previously identified 
      an imprinted region on chromosome 14, the DLK1-MEG3 locus, as being downregulated in 
      islets from humans with T2DM. In this study, using targeted epigenetic modifiers, we 
      prove that increased methylation at the promoter of Meg3 in mouse βTC6 β-cells 
      results in decreased transcription of the maternal transcripts associated with this 
      locus. As a result, the sensitivity of β-cells to cytokine-mediated oxidative stress 
      was increased. Additionally, we demonstrate that an evolutionarily conserved 
      intronic region at the MEG3 locus can function as an enhancer in βTC6 β-cells. Using 
      circular chromosome conformation capture followed by high-throughput sequencing, we 
      demonstrate that the promoter of MEG3 physically interacts with this novel enhancer 
      and other putative regulatory elements in this imprinted region in human islets. 
      Remarkably, this enhancer is bound in an allele-specific manner by the transcription 
      factors FOXA2, PDX1, and NKX2.2. Overall, these data suggest that the intronic MEG3 
      enhancer plays an important role in the regulation of allele-specific expression at 
      the imprinted DLK1-MEG3 locus in human β-cells, which in turn impacts the 
      sensitivity of β-cells to cytokine-mediated oxidative stress.

AB  - Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are emerging as contributors to malignancies. Little is 
      understood about the contribution of lncRNA to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT), which correlates with metastasis. Ovarian cancer is usually diagnosed after 
      metastasis. Here we report an integrated analysis of >700 ovarian cancer molecular 
      profiles, including genomic data sets, from four patient cohorts identifying lncRNA 
      DNM3OS, MEG3, and MIAT overexpression and their reproducible gene regulation in 
      ovarian cancer EMT. Genome-wide mapping shows 73% of MEG3-regulated EMT-linked 
      pathway genes contain MEG3 binding sites. DNM3OS overexpression, but not MEG3 or 
      MIAT, significantly correlates to worse overall patient survival. DNM3OS knockdown 
      results in altered EMT-linked genes/pathways, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, 
      and reduced cell migration and invasion. Proteotranscriptomic characterization 
      further supports the DNM3OS and ovarian cancer EMT connection. TWIST1 overexpression 
      and DNM3OS amplification provides an explanation for increased DNM3OS levels. 
      Therefore, our results elucidate lncRNA that regulate EMT and demonstrate DNM3OS 
      specifically contributes to EMT in ovarian cancer.

AB  - Long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is related to the occurrence 
      and development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the function and 
      underlying molecular mechanisms of MEG3 in lung cancer stem cells (LCSCs) are still 
      unclear. LCSCs were determined in lung cancer cells using fluorescence-activated 
      cell sorting (FACS). qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to examine the 
      expressions of MEG3, miR-650, solute carrier family 34 member 2 (SLC34A2), 
      octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), and CD133. Sphere assay was employed 
      to evaluate sphere-forming ability. Cell migration and invasion were analyzed by 
      Transwell assay. The relationships among MEG3, miR-650, and SLC34A2 were validated 
      by luciferase reporter, RIP, and RNA pulldown assays. We found MEG3 was 
      downregulated in LCSCs. MEG3 depletion strengthened stem cell-like characteristics 
      and sphere-forming ability in LCCs. Upregulation of MEG3 suppressed migration and 
      invasion in LCCs and LCSCs. miR-650 was bound to MEG3 and upregulated in LCSCs. 
      miR-650 inhibitor alleviated si-MEG3-induced promotion of stem cell-like 
      characteristics in lung cancer cells (LCCs) H1299. Furthermore, miR-650 mimic 
      attenuated the MEG3 upregulation-mediated inhibition of migration and invasion. In 
      addition, SLC34A2 was a target of miR-650 and downregulated in LCSCs. miR-650 mimic 
      induced stem cell-like characteristics in LCCs, which was weakened by overexpression 
      of SLC34A2. In contrast, the repression of SLC34A2 mitigated the miR-650 
      silencing-induced inhibition of migration and invasion in LCCs and LCSCs. Besides, 
      MEG3 regulated SLC34A2 expression by sponging miR-650. Importantly, SLC34A2 weakened 
      MEG3-mediated stem cell-like state and cell metastasis. Our data suggested MEG3 was 
      involved in stem cell-like state of LCCs and curbed migration and invasion through 
      miR-650/SLC34A2 axis in NSCLC.

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents 80% of adult leukemias and 15-20% of 
      childhood leukemias. AML are characterized by the presence of 20% blasts or more in 
      the bone marrow, or defining cytogenetic abnormalities. Laboratory diagnoses of 
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) depend on morphological changes based on dysplasia 
      in peripheral blood and bone marrow, including peripheral blood smears, bone marrow 
      aspirate smears, and bone marrow biopsies. As leukemic cells are not functional, the 
      patient develops anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, leading to fatigue, 
      recurrent infections, and hemorrhage. The genetic background and associated 
      mutations in AML blasts determine the clinical course of the disease. Over the last 
      decade, non-coding RNAs transcripts that do not codify for proteins but play a role 
      in regulation of functions have been shown to have multiple applications in the 
      diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic approach of various types of cancers, including 
      myeloid malignancies. After a comprehensive review of current literature, we found 
      reports of multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can differentiate between 
      AML types and how their exogenous modulation can dramatically change the behavior of 
      AML cells. These lncRNAs include: H19, LINC00877, RP11-84C10, CRINDE, RP11848P1.3, 
      ZNF667-AS1, AC111000.4-202, SFMBT2, LINC02082-201, MEG3, AC009495.2, PVT1, HOTTIP, 
      SNHG5, and CCAT1. In addition, by performing an analysis on available AML data in 
      The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we found 10 lncRNAs with significantly differential 
      expression between patients in favorable, intermediate/normal, or poor cytogenetic 
      risk categories. These are: DANCR, PRDM16-DT, SNHG6, OIP5-AS1, SNHG16, JPX, FTX, 
      KCNQ1OT1, TP73-AS1, and GAS5. The identification of a molecular signature based on 
      lncRNAs has the potential for have deep clinical significance, as it could 
      potentially help better define the evolution from low-grade MDS to high-grade MDS to 
      AML, changing the course of therapy. This would allow clinicians to provide a more 
      personalized, patient-tailored therapeutic approach, moving from transfusion-based 
      therapy, as is the case for low-grade MDS, to the introduction of azacytidine-based 
      chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which is the current treatment 
      for high-grade MDS.

TI  - Association between lncRNA GAS5, MEG3, and PCAT-1 Polymorphisms and Cancer Risk: A 
      Meta-Analysis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely studied, and single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in lncRNAs are considered to be genetic factors that 
      influence cancer susceptibility. The lncRNA GAS5, MEG3, and PCAT-1 polymorphisms are 
      shown to be possibly associated with cancer risk. The aim of this meta-analysis was 
      to systematically evaluate this association. METHODS: Studies were selected from 
      PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, the Chinese 
      National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature 
      Database (CBM) through inclusion and exclusion criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effects model or 
      fixed-effects model to assess the association between lncRNA polymorphisms and 
      cancer susceptibility. Metaregression and publication bias analyses were also 
      conducted. All analyses were performed using the Stata 12.0 software. RESULTS: 
      Sixteen articles (covering 13750 cases and 17194 controls) were included in this 
      meta-analysis. A significant association between SNP rs145204276 and gastric cancer 
      risk was observed (del vs. ins: OR = 0.79, 95%CI = 0.72-0.86; del/del vs. 
      ins/ins+del/ins: OR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.59-0.91; del/ins vs. ins/ins: OR = 0.84, 95%CI 
      = 0.67-1.05). For rs16901904, a decreased cancer risk was observed in three genetic 
      models (C vs. T: OR = 0.79, 95%CI = 0.70-0.90; CC vs. CT+TT: OR = 0.49, 95%CI = 
      0.37-0.65; CC vs. TT: OR = 0.49, 95%CI = 0.37-0.66). No statistical significance was 
      found in the metaregression analysis. For all of the included SNPs, no publication 
      bias was found in all genotype models. CONCLUSIONS: The rs145204276 SNP in lncRNA 
      GAS5 is likely to be associated with gastric cancer risk, whereas the rs16901904 SNP 
      in lncRNA PCAT-1 bears association with a decreased cancer risk.

TI  - High lncRNA MEG3 expression is associated with high mortality rates in patients with

AB  - Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) has been reported to be a 
      key component in cancer biology. Preliminary microarray data from a previous study 
      indicated that lncRNA MEG3 expression was altered in plasma of patients with sepsis. 
      The present study found that the plasma levels of lncRNA MEG3 were significantly 
      higher in sepsis patients compared with healthy controls. Patients were subsequently 
      divided into high and low lncRNA MEG3 expression groups according to the Youden's 
      index. Patients from the high lncRNA MEG3 expression group exhibited a significantly 
      higher mortality rate compared with those from the low lncRNA MEG3 expression group. 
      According to treatment outcomes, patients were divided into survival and mortality 
      groups. It was observed that the pre-therapy expression levels of lncRNA MEG3 were 
      significantly higher in mortality group compared with the survival group. Cell 
      experiments in vitro revealed that lncRNA MEG3 overexpression and silencing using 
      siRNA promoted and inhibited renal epithelial cell and cardiomyocyte apoptosis 
      induced by lipopolysaccharide, respectively. In conclusion, these data suggest that 
      lncRNA MEG3 overexpression may be involved in sepsis, and the downregulation of 
      lncRNA MEG3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for sepsis.

TI  - Exploring lncRNA-Mediated Regulatory Networks in Endometrial Cancer Cells and the 
      Tumor Microenvironment: Advances and Challenges.
LID - 10.3390/cancers11020234 [doi]
LID - 234
AB  - Recent studies have revealed both the promise and challenges of targeting long 
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to diagnose and treat endometrial cancer (EC). LncRNAs are 
      upregulated or downregulated in ECs compared to normal tissues and their 
      dysregulation has been linked to tumor grade, FIGO stage, the depth of myometrial 
      invasion, lymph node metastasis and patient survival. Tumor suppressive lncRNAs 
      (GAS5, MEG3, FER1L4 and LINC00672) and oncogenic lncRNAs (CCAT2, BANCR, NEAT1, 
      MALAT1, H19 and Linc-RoR) have been identified as upstream modulators or downstream 
      effectors of major signaling pathways influencing EC metastasis, including the 
      PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, WNT/β-catenin and p53 signaling pathways. TUG1 
      and TDRG1 stimulate the VEGF-A pathway. PCGEM1 is implicated in activating the 
      JAK/STAT3 pathway. Here, we present an overview of the expression pattern, 
      prognostic value, biological function of lncRNAs in EC cells and their roles within 
      the tumor microenvironment, focusing on the influence of lncRNAs on established 
      EC-relevant pathways. We also describe the emerging classification of EC subtypes 
      based on their lncRNA signature and discuss the clinical implications of lncRNAs as 
      valuable biomarkers for EC diagnosis and potential targets for EC treatment.

TI  - TET2 and MEG3 promoter methylation is associated with acute myeloid leukemia in a 
      Hainan population.
PG  - 18337-18347
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.15440 [doi]
AB  - The promoter of MEG3, which encodes the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MEG3, is often 
      hypermethylated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Additionally, the Tet 
      methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 gene (TET2) is frequently inactivated, which can lead 
      to impaired DNA methylation and promote AML development. We examined the association 
      between TET2 and MEG3 promoter hypermethylation in Hainan patients with AML. The 
      expression of MEG3, TET2, miR-22-3p, and miR-22-5p was assessed in bone marrow 
      samples from AML patients and healthy controls using real-time quantitative PCR. 
      Using Sequenom MassARRAY technology, we compared MEG3 promoter methylation in AML 
      patients and healthy controls. MEG3 expression was lower in AML patients than in the 
      controls (P = 0.136). Moreover, there was greater methylation of MEG3 promoter in 
      the AML patients than the controls (P < 0.05). Methylation of the MEG3 promoter 
      correlated negatively with TET2 expression (P < 0.05, r < 0). Likewise there was a 
      negative correlation between TET2 activity and MEG3 promoter methylation (P < 0.05, 
      r < 0). These results suggest that hypermethylation of the MEG3 promoter in AML may 
      result from decreased TET2 activity. These data provide insight into the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying AML development and progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The delta-like non-canonical Notch ligand 1 (DLK1)-maternally expressed 
      3(MEG3) locus (DLK1-MEG3 locus) plays a critical role in the maintenance and 
      differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Accumulating evidence implicates the 
      imprinted genes from this locus, DLK1 and MEG3, in the development and progression 
      of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the contribution of this locus to the 
      treatment response of patients and their survival is unknown. METHODS: DNA 
      methylation of select CG dinucleotide-containing amplicons (CpG sites) within the 
      DLK1-MEG3 locus and within differentially methylated regions of other imprinted loci 
      was assessed in the mononuclear cells of 45 AML patients by combined bisulfite 
      restriction analysis. Methylation results were compared with patient response to 
      first-round induction therapy and overall survival. Multivariable analysis was 
      employed to identify independent prognostic factors for patient overall survival in 
      AML. RESULTS: Increased methylation at CpG sites within the MEG3 promotor region was 
      observed in AML patients having longer overall survival. In addition, patients with 
      shorter overall survival had increased expression of DLK1 and MEG3, and methylation 
      at the MEG3-DMR CpG site inversely correlated with MEG3 expression. Multivariable 
      analysis revealed that methylation at CG9, a non-imprinted CpG site within the MEG3 
      promotor region which contains a CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-binding DNA sequence, 
      is an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival of AML patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of our pilot study underscore the importance of the 
      DLK1-MEG3 locus in AML development and progression. We identify CG9 methylation as 
      an independent prognostic factor for AML patient survival, which suggests that 
      distinct miRNA signatures from the DLK1-MEG3 locus could reflect varying degrees of 
      cell stemness and present novel opportunities for personalized therapies in the 
      future. These data provide a foundation for future studies into the role of 
      higher-order chromatin structure at DLK1-MEG3 in AML.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly devastating disease with poor 
      prognosis and rising incidence worldwide. Late detection and particularly aggressive 
      characteristics are the major challenges that lead to therapeutic failure of this 
      disease. A well described gene program and core regulators are yet to be discovered 
      to drive the metastasis of the PDAC cells. As the development of single cell omics 
      technologies including single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), detailed 
      characterization of the cellular composition of solid tumors and their 
      microenvironments are well elaborated. In the current study, we accessed a recently 
      published scRNA-seq dataset on primary and metastatic PDAC tissues and subset the 
      tumor cells. By comparative analysis, we profiled the differentially expressed gene 
      programs of primary and metastatic PDAC and found several long intergenic non-coding 
      RNAs (LincRNAs) in top genes. The PDAC cancer cells showed some heterogeneity and 
      were divided into four major subclusters based on gene profiles, one of which was 
      mostly contributed by metastatic PDAC. Interestingly, this subcluster was remarkably 
      marked by one of the above LincRNAs, MEG3, and exhibited significantly increased 
      Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT) signatures. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) 
      on the signature genes of this subcluster gave multiple cancer metastasis associated 
      and EMT signaling pathways, suggesting a critical role of this cluster in leading 
      tumor cell metastasis. Taken together, this study displayed a PDAC cancer subcluster 
      and its marker gene, biologically targeting of which might significantly attenuate 
      the metastasis of tumor and might be a potential strategy for the therapeutic 
      treatment of cancer.

TI  - Long noncoding RNA Meg3 sponges miR-708 to inhibit intestinal tumorigenesis via 
      SOCS3-repressed cancer stem cells growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the most common gastrointestinal cancer 
      and a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with most showing pathologies 
      indicating the malignant transformation of early stage intestinal stem cells. The 
      long non-coding RNA Meg3, which functions as a tumor suppressor, has been reported 
      to be abnormal in multiple tumorigenesis events; however, the underlying mechanism 
      by which Meg3 contributes to the malignant proliferation of colonic stem cells 
      remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed the expression levels of Meg3, miR-708, and 
      SOCS3 in samples from Apc loss-of-function (Apc(min)) mice and patients with CRC, 
      particularly in colonic crypt cells. Apc(min) mice and AMO/DSS-induced mice model 
      (in vivo) and organoid culture system (in vitro) were used to explore the effect of 
      the Meg3/miR-708/SOCS3 axis on tumorigenesis in the colon. In vitro, we performed 
      RNApull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays using DLD1 and 
      RKO cell lines. FINDINGS: The Meg3/miR-708/SOCS3 signaling axis plays a critical 
      role in the early stage of CRC development. Our data showed Meg3 levels negatively 
      correlate with miR-708 levels both in clinical samples and in the Apc(min) mouse 
      model, which indicated that Meg3 acts as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of 
      miR-708. Then, miR-708 served as an oncogene, inducing neoplasia in both Apc(min) 
      mice and cultured colonic organoids. Put together, miR-708 appears to promote 
      malignant proliferation of colonic stem cells by targeting SOCS3/STAT3 signaling. 
      INTERPRETATION: These data revealed that Meg3 sponges miR-708 to inhibit CRC 
      development via SOCS3-mediated repression of the malignant proliferation of colonic 
      stem cells. The Meg3/miR-708/SOCS3 signaling axis provides potential targets for the 
      diagnosis and treatment of CRC, particularly early stage CRC.

AB  - Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a pivotal event in liver fibrosis, is 
      considered as an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Deregulation of 
      long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been reported to be involved in a series of human 
      diseases. LncRNA-maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) functions as a tumor suppressor 
      in cancers and has been shown to play a vital role in EMT process. However, the 
      biological role of MEG3 in liver fibrosis is largely unknown. In this study, MEG3 
      was reduced in vivo and in vitro during liver fibrosis. Restoring of MEG3 expression 
      led to the suppression of liver fibrosis, with a reduction in α-SMA and type I 
      collagen. Notably, MEG3 overexpression inhibited HSC activation through EMT, 
      associated with an increase in epithelial markers and a reduction in mesenchymal 
      markers. Further studies showed that Hedgehog (Hh) pathway-mediated EMT process was 
      involved in the effects of MEG3 on HSC activation. Smoothened (SMO) is a member of 
      Hh pathway. Using bioinformatic analysis, an interaction between MEG3 and SMO 
      protein was predicted. This interaction was confirmed by the results of RNA 
      immunoprecipitation and deletion-mapping analysis. Furthermore, MEG3 was confirmed 
      as a target of microRNA-212 (miR-212). miR-212 was partly responsible for the 
      effects of MEG3 on EMT process. Interestingly, MEG3 was also reduced in chronic 
      hepatitis B (CHB) patients with liver fibrosis when compared with healthy controls. 
      MEG3 negatively correlated with fibrosis stage in CHB patients. In conclusion, we 
      demonstrate that MEG3 inhibits Hh-mediated EMT process in liver fibrosis via SMO 
      protein and miR-212.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last few years, accumulating evidence has indicated that numerous 
      long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abnormally expressed in gastric cancer (GC) and 
      are associated with the survival of GC patients. This study aimed to conduct a 
      meta-analysis on 19 lncRNAs (AFAP1 antisense RNA 1 [AFAP1-AS1], CDKN2B antisense RNA 
      1 [ANRIL], cancer susceptibility 15 [CASC15], colon cancer associated transcript 2 
      [CCAT2], gastric adenocarcinoma associated, positive CD44 regulator, long intergenic 
      noncoding RNA [GAPLINC], H19, imprinted maternally expressed transcript [H19], HOX 
      transcript antisense RNA [HOTAIR], HOXA distal transcript antisense RNA [HOTTIP], 
      long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 673 [LINC00673], metastasis-associated lung 
      adenocarcinoma transcript 1 [MALAT1], maternally expressed 3 [MEG3], promoter of 
      CDKN1A antisense DNA damage activated RNA [PANDAR], Pvt1 oncogene [PVT1], SOX2 
      overlapping transcript [Sox2ot], SPRY4 intronic transcript 1 [SPRY4-IT1], urothelial 
      cancer associated 1 [UCA1], X inactive specific transcript [XIST], ZEB1 antisense 
      RNA 1 [ZEB1-AS1] and ZNFX1 antisense RNA 1 [ZFAS1]) to systematically estimate their 
      prognostic value in GC. METHODS: The qualified literature was systematically 
      searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Database of Systematic 
      Reviews (up to March 16, 2018), and one meta-analysis relating to the relationship 
      between lncRNA expression and overall survival (OS) of GC patients was performed. 
      The only evaluation criterion of survival results was OS. RESULTS: A total of 6,095 
      GC patients and 19 lncRNAs from 51 articles were included in the present study. 
      Among the listed 19 lncRNAs, 18 lncRNAs (other than SPRY4-IT1) showed a 
      significantly prognostic value (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggested 
      that the abnormally expressed lncRNAs (AFAP1-AS1, ANRIL, CASC15, CCAT2, GAPLINC, 
      H19, HOTAIR, HOTTIP, LINC00673, MALAT1, MEG3, PANDAR, PVT1, Sox2ot, UCA1, XIST, 
      ZEB1-AS1 and ZFAS1) were significantly associated with the survival of GC patients, 
      among which AFAP1-AS1, CCAT2, LINC00673, PANDAR, PVT1, Sox2ot, ZEB1-AS1 and ZFAS1 
      were strong candidates in predicting the prognosis of GC patients.

PG  - 3140-3157
LID - 10.21037/tcr-21-230 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) belong to an extremely heterogeneous class of 
      non-coding RNAs with a length ranging from 200 to 100,000 bp. They modulate a series 
      of cellular pathways in both physiological and pathological context. It is no 
      coincidence that they are expressed in an aberrant way in pathologies such as 
      cancer, so as to deserve to be subclassified as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. 
      These molecules are also involved in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation. 
      Several lncRNAs are able to modulate cell growth both positively and negatively, and 
      in this review we have focused on a small group of them, characterized by the 
      simultaneous action on different pathways regulating cell proliferation. They have 
      been considered in the light of their behavior in three different subtypes of 
      proliferative pathways that we can define as (I) tumor suppressor, (II) oncogenic 
      and (III) transcriptionally-driven. More specifically, we have characterized some 
      lncRNAs considered oncogenes (such as H19, linc-ROR, MALAT1, HULC, HOTAIR and 
      ANRIL), tumor suppressors (such as MEG3 and lincRNA-p21), and both oncogenes/tumor 
      suppressors (UCA1 and TUG1) in a little more detail. As can be understood from the 
      review, the interactions between lncRNAs and their molecular targets, only in the 
      context of controlling cell proliferation, give rise to an intricate molecular 
      network, the understanding of which, in the future, will certainly be of help for 
      the treatment of molecular diseases such as cancer.

AB  - Human clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFAs) account for approximately 
      40% of diagnosed pituitary tumors. Epigenetic mutations in tumor suppressive genes 
      play an important role in NFA development. Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is a 
      long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and we hypothesized that it is a candidate tumor 
      suppressor whose epigenetic silencing is specifically linked to NFA development. In 
      this study, we introduced MEG3 expression into PDFS cells, derived from a human NFA, 
      using both inducible and constitutively active expression systems. MEG3 expression 
      significantly suppressed xenograft tumor growth in vivo in nude mice. When induced 
      in culture, MEG3 caused cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. In addition, inactivation 
      of p53 completely abolished tumor suppression by MEG3, indicating that MEG3 tumor 
      suppression is mediated by p53. In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that 
      MEG3 is a lncRNA tumor suppressor in the pituitary and its inactivation contributes 
      to NFA development.

AB  - T-lymphocytes (T cells) play a major role in adaptive immunity and current immune 
      checkpoint inhibitor-based cancer treatments. The regulation of their function is 
      complex, and in addition to cytokines, receptors and transcription factors, several 
      non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been shown to affect differentiation and function of T 
      cells. Among these non-coding RNAs, certain small microRNAs (miRNAs) including 
      miR-15a/16-1, miR-125b-5p, miR-99a-5p, miR-128-3p, let-7 family, miR-210, 
      miR-182-5p, miR-181, miR-155 and miR-10a have been well recognized. Meanwhile, 
      IFNG-AS1, lnc-ITSN1-2, lncRNA-CD160, NEAT1, MEG3, GAS5, NKILA, lnc-EGFR and PVT1 are 
      among long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that efficiently influence the function of T 
      cells. Recent studies have underscored the effects of a number of circular RNAs, 
      namely circ_0001806, hsa_circ_0045272, hsa_circ_0012919, hsa_circ_0005519 and 
      circHIPK3 in the modulation of T-cell apoptosis, differentiation and secretion of 
      cytokines. This review summarizes the latest news and regulatory roles of these 
      ncRNAs on the function of T cells, with widespread implications on the 
      pathophysiology of autoimmune disorders and cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To understand the effect of DNMT1-mediated MEG3 promoter methylation on 
      breast cancer progression. METHODS: Expression of DNMT1, MEG3 and miR-494-3p was 
      assayed by qRT-PCR and western blot. Methylation-specific PCR was used to examine 
      MEG3 promoter methylation level. ChIP, RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation assay 
      and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay were applied to verify interaction between 
      DNMT1 and MEG3, miR-494-3p and MEG3 and OTUD4. CCK-8, wound healing and Transwell 
      assays were used to detect biological functions of breast cancer cells. Tumor growth 
      was observed by tumor xenograft model. RESULTS: DNMT1 and miR-494-3p were highly 
      expressed while MEG3 and OTUD4 were lowly expressed in breast cancer cells. 
      Knockdown of DNMT1 inhibited progression of breast cancer cells by enhance MEG3 
      expression through demethylation. MEG3 could downregulate miR-494-3p expression, and 
      OTUD4 was a target of miR-494-3p. Upregulation of MEG3 and downregulation of 
      miR-494-3p both inhibited malignant behavior of cells in vitro. In addition, high 
      MEG3 expression restrained growth of breast cancer in vivo. CONCLUSION: Briefly, our 
      results demonstrated that, DNMT1 induced methylation of MEG3 promoter, and played a 
      key role in breast cancer growth throughmiR-494-3p/OTUD4 axis. These findings 
      provide new insights into molecular therapeutic targets for breast cancer.

AB  - Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located on 
      chromosome 14q32.3. Direct sequencing experiments have shown monoallelic expression 
      of this lncRNA. Several studies have shown down-regulation of this lncRNA in human 
      cancers. In some cases, hypermethylation of the promoter region has been suggested 
      as the underlying mechanism. Functional studies have shown that this lncRNA controls 
      expression of several tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes among them are p53, RB, 
      MYC and TGF-β. Through regulation of Wnt-β-catenin pathway, it also affects 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In vitro studies have demonstrated contribution 
      of MEG3 in defining response to chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel, 
      cisplatin and oxaliplatin. Certain polymorphisms within MEG3 are implicated in 
      cancer risk (rs7158663, rs4081134 and rs11160608) or therapeutic response of cancer 
      patients (rs10132552). Taken together, this lncRNA is regarded as a putative cancer 
      biomarker and treatment target. In the current review, several aspects of the 
      participation of MEG3 in carcinogenesis are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can play 
      a substantial role in gallbladder cancer (GBC) development as tumor promotors or 
      suppressors, and their abnormal expression is relevant to GBC patient outcomes. We 
      completed this systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the clinical 
      significance and mechanisms of lncRNAs in GBC. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive 
      literature search and selected eligible records according to the inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria. Hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) were extracted or 
      calculated to estimate the relationships of high lncRNA expression with GBC patient 
      survival and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were identified as 
      eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Heterogeneity among HRs of 
      overall survival (OS) was notably high (I(2) = 86.2%, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis 
      suggested that overexpression of lncRNAs in a group that is upregulated in GBC 
      showed a significant association with poor OS (HR = 2.454, 95% CI 2.004-3.004, 
      I(2) = 0%). Conversely, overexpression of lncRNAs in a downregulated group was 
      markedly related to good OS (HR = 0.371, 95% CI 0.267-0.517, I(2) = 0%). High 
      expression levels of lncRNA AFAP1-AS1, MALAT1 and ROR were positively correlated 
      with tumor size. Expression of lncRNA LET, LINC00152 and HEGBC exhibited a positive 
      correlation with high T status. LncRNA LINC00152, HEGBC, MALAT1 and ROR showed a 
      marked correlation with positive lymph node metastasis (LNM), while lncRNA GCASPC, 
      MEG3, LET and UCA1 had the opposite effect. High expression levels of lncRNA HEGBC, 
      PAGBC, PVT1 and UCA1 predicted high tumor node metastasis (TNM) stages, while lncRNA 
      LET, GCASPC and MEG3 indicated low TNM stages. We also summarized the mechanisms of 
      lncRNAs in GBC. CONCLUSION: Aberrant expression of several lncRNAs was indicative of 
      the prognosis of GBC patients, and lncRNAs showed promise as biomarkers and 
      therapeutic targets for GBC.

AB  - Background LncRNAs are known to take part in normal brain functions and nervous 
      system diseases. Little evidence has pointed to the dysregulation of lncRNAs in 
      congenital intestinal atresia. We aimed to investigate the underlying molecular 
      mechanism of congenital intestinal atresia that involves in lncRNA-MEG3. Materials 
      and methods The expressions of LncRNA-MEG3, miR-211-5p and GDNF were determined by 
      the qRT-PCR and Western blot assay when appropriate. The results were verified in 
      intestinal atresia Wistar rat model and bone marrow derived stem cell 
      (BMSCs)-derived into intestinal ganglion cells. RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA 
      pull-down assays were performed to analyze the regulatory mechanism between MEG3 and 
      miR-211-5p. The effects of MEG3 on the cell proliferation and apoptosis of isolated 
      intestinal ganglion cells were detected with an MTT assay and flow cytometry, 
      respectively. Results The expression of MEG3 was detected to be declined in 
      congenital intestinal atresia tissues at clinic and animal levels. MEG3 promoted the 
      differentiation of BMSCs into intestinal ganglion cells and regulated GDNF 
      expression in retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5 cells) via targeting miR-211-5p. Hypoxia 
      induced the apoptosis of intestinal ganglion cells via MEG3/miR-211-5p/GDNF axis. 
      Conclusion MEG3 promoted the differentiation of BMSCs into intestinal ganglion cells 
      and inhibited the apoptosis of intestinal ganglion cells under the exposure of 
      hypoxia to protect against CIA injury via directly regulating miR-211-5p/GDNF axis.

TI  - Coordinated silencing of the Sp1-mediated long noncoding RNA MEG3 by EZH2 and HDAC3 
      as a prognostic factor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a disease with high mortality. 
      Many so-called "junk" noncoding RNAs need to be discovered in PDAC. The purpose of 
      this study was therefore to investigate the function and regulatory mechanism of the 
      long noncoding RNA MEG3 in PDAC. METHODS: The Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO 
      database) was used to determine the differential expression of long noncoding RNAs 
      in PDAC, and MEG3 was selected for subsequent verification. Tissue and cell samples 
      were used to verify MEG3 expression, followed by functional detection in vitro and 
      in vivo. Microarrays were used to characterize long noncoding RNA and mRNA 
      expression profiles. Competing endogenous RNA analyses were used to detect 
      differential MEG3 and relational miRNA expression in PDAC. Finally, promoter 
      analyses were conducted to explain the downregulation of MEG3 PDAC. RESULTS: We 
      generated a catalogue of PDAC-associated long noncoding RNAs in the GEO database. 
      The ectopic expression of MEG3 inhibited PDAC growth and metastasis in vitro and in 
      vivo, which was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Microarray analysis showed 
      that multiple microRNAs interacted with MEG3. We also showed that MEG3, as a 
      competing endogenous RNA, directly sponged miR-374a-5p to regulate PTEN expression. 
      The transcription factor, Sp1, recruited EZH2 and HDAC3 to the promoter and 
      transcriptionally repressed MEG3 expression. Finally, clinical data showed that MEG3 
      and miR-374a-5p expressions were correlated with clinicopathological features. 
      Statistically, Sp1, EZH2, HDAC3, and miR-374a-5p were negatively correlated with 
      MEG3 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced MEG3 levels played a crucial role in the PDAC 
      malignant phenotype, which provided insight into novel and effective molecular 
      targets of MEG3 for pancreatic cancer treatment.

TI  - Overexpression of long non-coding RNA MEG3 suppresses breast cancer cell 
      proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis through AKT pathway.
PG  - 1010428317701311
LID - 10.1177/1010428317701311 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNA MEG3 has been identified as a tumor suppressor which plays 
      important roles in tumorigenesis; however, its potential role in breast cancer has 
      not been fully examined. Here, we showed that MEG3 was downregulated in breast 
      cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of MEG3 inhibited breast cancer cell 
      proliferation and invasion, suggesting that MEG3 played an important role in breast 
      cancer progression and metastasis. Moreover, MEG3 upregulation caused marked 
      inhibition of angiogenesis-related factor expression. Conditioned medium derived 
      from MEG3 overexpressed breast cancer cells significantly decreased the capillary 
      tube formation of endothelial cells. Furthermore, elevated expression of MEG3 in 
      breast cancer inhibits in vivo tumorigenesis and angiogenesis in a nude mouse 
      xenograft model. Mechanistically, overexpression of MEG3 results in downregulation 
      of AKT signaling, which is pivotal for breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and 
      tumor angiogenesis. Collectively, these results suggest that MEG3 might suppress the 
      tumor growth and angiogenesis via AKT signaling pathway and MEG3 may serve as a 
      potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic target of breast cancer.

AB  - Abnormal regulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) appears to be a primary 
      feature of numerous types of human cancer. However, the association between the 
      dysregulation of lncRNAs and functional alterations in gastric cancer (GC) remains 
      unclear. In previous studies, we applied microarray and bioinformatics analyses to 
      screen for key lncRNAs from the tumor tissues and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues 
      of 10 patients with GC. There were seven key lncRNAs demonstrated to be 
      significantly different between carcinoma tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues. In 
      the present study, the expression of these seven selected lncRNAs were validated in 
      82 patients with GC to further investigate the association between lncRNAs and GC 
      clinical characterization. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-qPCR) results demonstrated that RP5-919F19, MCPH1 antisense RNA 1 
      (CTD-2541M15) and urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) exhibited consistent 
      upregulation in cancer compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues, whereas AP000459, 
      LOC101928316, tumor suppressor candidate 8 (LINC01071) and maternally expressed 3 
      (MEG3) showed consistent downregulation. The results from the microarray and RT-qPCR 
      experiments achieved 100% agreement. A correlation analysis indicated that 
      RP5-919F19, LOC101928316 and MEG3 were significantly associated with tumor 
      differentiation degree, RP5-919F19, UCA1 and MEG3 were significantly associated with 
      lymph node metastasis, and RP5-919F19, CTD-2541M15 and UCA1 were significantly 
      associated with tumor-node-metastasis stage (P<0.05). In addition, it was identified 
      that the differential expression of LINC01071 and LOC101928316 significantly 
      correlated with the age and gender of the GC patients, respectively (P<0.05). The 
      results suggest that the lncRNAs RP5-919F19, LOC101928316, CTD-2541M15, UCA1 and 
      MEG3 are closely associated with the invasion and metastasis of GC, which reveals 
      these indicators as potential specificity biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis 
      and classification of GC. Thus, these lncRNAs merit further study as novel candidate 
      biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of GC and as potential targets for therapy.

      in the development of multiple myeloma.
PG  - 637-645
LID - 10.3892/etm.2020.8723 [doi]
AB  - Methylation is a fundamental regulator of gene transcription. Long non-coding RNA 
      maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) inhibits cell proliferation in various types of 
      cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of MEG3 methylation in the regulation of 
      multiple myeloma (MM) are unknown. In the present study, MEG3 upregulation was 
      negatively associated with the International Staging System (ISS) status of the bone 
      marrow samples of 39 patients with MM. MEG3 overexpression in an MM cell line 
      resulted in elevated p53 expression. Furthermore, the results of 
      methylation-specific PCR revealed that the abnormal methylation status of the MEG3 
      promoter region was present in eight of the 39 bone marrow samples collected. 
      Treatment of the MM cell line with the DNA methylation inhibitor 
      5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) resulted in tumor cell proliferation inhibition, 
      apoptosis induction and G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, 5-Aza-CdR 
      decreased aberrant hypermethylation of the MEG3 promoter and increased the 
      expression of MEG3. However, 5-Aza-CdR exerted no effect on p53 expression. To the 
      best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report that the 
      demethylation reagent 5-Aza-CdR may serve as a therapeutic agent in MM by 
      upregulating MEG3 expression. However, the mechanism of action was independent of 
      p53 expression.

AB  - Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are reported to be expressed in human cancers, including 
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These ncRNAs affect the growth, migration 
      and invasion of tumor cells by regulating cell cycle and apoptosis, as well as 
      playing important roles in epigenetic processes, transcription and 
      post-transcriptional regulation. It is still unclear whether alterations in ncRNAs 
      influence PDAC development and progression. Because of this, analysis based on 
      existing data on ncRNAs, which are crucial for modulating pancreatic tumorigenesis, 
      will be important for future research on PDAC. Here, we summarize ncRNAs with 
      tumor-promoting functions: HOTAIR, HOTTIP, MALAT1, lncRNA H19, lncRNA PVT1, circ-RNA 
      ciRS-7, circ-0030235, circ-RNA_100782, circ-LDLRAD3, circ-0007534, circRHOT1, 
      circZMYM2, circ-IARS, circ-RNA PDE8A, miR-21, miR-155, miR-221/222, miR-196b, 
      miR-10a. While others including GAS5, MEG3, and lncRNA ENST00000480739, 
      has_circ_0001649, miR-34a, miR-100, miR-217, miR-143 inhibit the proliferation and 
      invasion of PDAC. Hence, we summarize the functions of ncRNAs in the occurrence, 
      development and metastasis of PDAC, with the goal to provide guidance in the 
      clinical diagnosis and treatment of PDAC.

TI  - Association between well-characterized lung cancer lncRNA polymorphisms and 
      platinum-based chemotherapy toxicity in Chinese patients with lung cancer.
PG  - 581-590
LID - 10.1038/aps.2016.164 [doi]
AB  - Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for most lung 
      cancer patients. However, the toxicity induced by platinum-based chemotherapy 
      greatly impedes its clinical use. Previous studies showed that long non-coding RNAs 
      (lncRNAs) with over 200 nucleotides in length affect drug response and toxicity. In 
      the present study, we investigated the association of well-characterized lung cancer 
      lncRNA polymorphisms with platinum-based chemotherapy toxicity in Chinese patients 
      with lung cancer. A total of 467 lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based 
      chemotherapy for at least two cycles were recruited. We primarily focused on 
      gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities. A total of 14 potentially functional 
      polymorphisms within 8 lncRNAs (HOTTIP, HOTAIT, H19, ANRIL, CCAT2, MALAT1, MEG3, and 
      POLR2E) were genotyped. Unconditional logistical regression analysis was conducted 
      to assess the associations. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions were 
      identified using the software generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction 
      (GMDR). ANRIL rs1333049 was associated with severe overall toxicity in an additive 
      model (adjusted OR=0.723, 95% CI=0.541-0.965, P=0.028). ANRIL rs1333049 was also 
      associated with severe gastrointestinal toxicity in both the additive (adjusted 
      OR=0.690, 95% CI=0.489-0.974, P=0.035) and dominant (adjusted OR=0.558, 95% 
      CI=0.335-0.931, P=0.025) models. MEG3 rs116907618 was associated with severe 
      gastrointestinal toxicity in an additive model (adjusted OR=1.717, 95% 
      CI=1.007-2.927, P=0.047). GMDR identified the three-factor interaction model of 
      POLR2E rs3787016-HOTTIP rs3807598-chemotherapy regimen as the best predictive model 
      for hematological toxicity. In conclusion, ANRIL and MEG3 genetic polymorphisms are 
      associated with severe platinum toxicity and could be considered as biomarkers for 
      pretreatment evaluation in Chinese patients with lung cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of overexpression of long noncoding RNA 
      (lncRNA) MEG3 on the proliferation and invasion of glioblastoma U251 cells by 
      suppressing the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α(HIF1α). METHODS: The 
      expression of lncRNA MEG3 and HIF1α mRNA were examined in human fetal glial cells 
      (HFGCs) and U251 cells using realtime quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and the expression 
      of HIF1α protein was detected with Western blotting.U251 cells in normal culture or 
      transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector (NC group) or pcDNA3.1-MEG3 vector via 
      lipofectamine2000 were exposed to hypoxia for 12h, and the expressions of HIF1α mRNA 
      and protein were detected with qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.MTT assay 
      and Transwell assay were employed to examine the influence of MEG3 overexpression on 
      the proliferation and invasion of U251 cells. RESULTS: The expression of MEG3 was 
      significantly lower and HIF1α mRNA and protein expressions were significantly higher 
      in U251 cells than in HFGCs (P < 0.05).In U251 cells, overexpression of MEG3 
      significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expressions of HIF1α(P < 0.05).Hypoxic 
      exposure for 12h also resulted in significantly lowered expression of HIF1α protein 
      in U251 cells (P < 0.05).Overexpression of MEG3 obviously suppressed the 
      proliferation and invasiveness of U251 cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MEG3 
      overexpression inhibits the proliferation and invasion of U251 cells through 
      suppressing the expression of HIF1α mRNA and protein, suggesting that MEG3 may serve 
      as a potential therapeutic target for glioblastomas.

TI  - Long noncoding RNA NEAT1 drives aggressive endometrial cancer progression via 
      miR-361-regulated networks involving STAT3 and tumor microenvironment-related genes.
PG  - 295

LID - 295
AB  - BACKGROUND: High-grade endometrioid and serous endometrial cancers (ECs) are an 
      aggressive subtype of ECs without effective therapies. The reciprocal communication 
      between tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment drives tumor progression. 
      Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key mediators of tumorigenesis and metastasis. 
      However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in aggressive EC progression and 
      tumor microenvironment remodeling. METHODS: We performed an array-based lncRNA 
      analysis of a parental HEC-50 EC cell population and derivatives with highly 
      invasive, sphere-forming, and paclitaxel (TX)-resistant characteristics. We 
      characterized the roles of the lncRNA NEAT1 in mediating aggressive EC progression 
      in vitro and in vivo and explored the molecular events downstream of NEAT1. RESULTS: 
      We identified 10 lncRNAs with upregulated expression (NEAT1, H19, PVT1, UCA1, 
      MIR7-3HG, SNHG16, HULC, RMST, BCAR4 and LINC00152) and 10 lncRNAs with downregulated 
      expression (MEG3, GAS5, DIO3OS, MIR155HG, LINC00261, FENDRR, MIAT, TMEM161B-AS1, 
      HAND2-AS1 and NBR2) in the highly invasive, sphere-forming and TX-resistant 
      derivatives. NEAT1 expression was markedly upregulated in early-stage EC tissue 
      samples, and high NEAT1 expression predicted a poor prognosis. Inhibiting NEAT1 
      expression with small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) diminished cellular proliferation, 
      invasion, sphere formation, and xenograft tumor growth and improved TX response in 
      aggressive EC cells. We showed that NEAT1 functions as an oncogenic sponge for the 
      tumor suppressor microRNA-361 (miR-361), which suppresses proliferation, invasion, 
      sphere formation and TX resistance by directly targeting the oncogene STAT3. 
      Furthermore, miR-361 also suppressed the expression of multiple prometastatic genes 
      and tumor microenvironment-related genes, including MEF2D, ROCK1, WNT7A, VEGF-A, 
      PDE4B, and KPNA4. CONCLUSIONS: NEAT1 initiates a miR-361-mediated network to drive 
      aggressive EC progression. These data support a rationale for inhibiting NEAT1 
      signaling as a potential therapeutic strategy for overcoming aggressive EC 
      progression and chemoresistance.

TI  - The Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in Female Oriented Cancers.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13236102 [doi]
LID - 6102
AB  - Recent advances in molecular biology have discovered the mysterious role of long 
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and targets 
      for advanced cancer therapy. Studies have shown that lncRNAs take part in the 
      incidence and development of cancers in humans. However, previously they were 
      considered as mere RNA noise or transcription byproducts lacking any biological 
      function. In this article, we present a summary of the progress on ascertaining the 
      biological functions of five lncRNAs (HOTAIR, NEAT1, H19, MALAT1, and MEG3) in 
      female-oriented cancers, including breast and gynecological cancers, with the 
      perspective of carcinogenesis, cancer proliferation, and metastasis. We provide the 
      current state of knowledge from the past five years of the literature to discuss the 
      clinical importance of such lncRNAs as therapeutic targets or early diagnostic 
      biomarkers. We reviewed the consequences, either oncogenic or tumor-suppressing 
      features, of their aberrant expression in female-oriented cancers. We tried to 
      explain the established mechanism by which they regulate cancer proliferation and 
      metastasis by competing with miRNAs and other mechanisms involved via regulating 
      genes and signaling pathways. In addition, we revealed the association between 
      stated lncRNAs and chemo-resistance or radio-resistance and their potential clinical 
      applications and future perspectives.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer has been the first death cause of cancer in women all over 
      the world. Metastasis is believed to be the most important process for treating 
      breast cancer. There is evidence that lncRNA MEG3 functions as a tumor suppressor in 
      breast cancer metastasis. However, upstream regulation of MEG3 in breast cancer 
      remain elusive. Therefore, it is critical to elucidate the underlying mechanism 
      upstream MEG3 to regulate breast cancer metastasis. METHODS: We employed RT-qPCR and 
      Western blot to examine expression level of miR-506, DNMT1, SP1, SP3 and MEG3. 
      Besides, methylation-specific PCR was used to determine the methylation level of 
      MEG3 promoter. Wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay were utilized to 
      measure migration and invasion ability of breast cancer cells, respectively. 
      RESULTS: SP was upregulated while miR-506 and MEG3 were downregulated in breast 
      tumor tissue compared to adjacent normal breast tissues. In addition, we found that 
      miR-506 regulated DNMT1 expression in an SP1/SP3-dependent manner, which reduced 
      methylation level of MEG3 promoter and upregulated MEG3 expression. SP3 knockdown or 
      miR-506 mimic suppressed migration and invasion of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells 
      whereas overexpression of SP3 compromised miR-506-inhibited migration and invasion. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal a novel axis of miR-506/SP3/SP1/DNMT1/MEG3 in 
      regulating migration and invasion of breast cancer cell lines, which provide 
      rationales for developing effective therapies to treating metastatic breast cancers.

TI  - Long non‑coding RNA MEG3 suppresses epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition by 
      inhibiting the PSAT1‑dependent GSK‑3β/Snail signaling pathway in esophageal squamous 
      cell carcinoma.
PG  - 2130-2142
LID - 10.3892/or.2020.7754 [doi]
AB  - Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the main subtype of esophageal cancer 
      in China, and the prognosis of patients remains poor mainly due to the occurrence of 
      lymph node and distant metastasis. The long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (MEG3) has been shown to have tumor‑suppressive properties and to 
      play an important role in epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) in some solid 
      tumors. However, whether MEG3 is involved in EMT in ESCC remains unclear. In the 
      present study, the MEG3 expression level and its association with tumorigenesis were 
      determined in 43 tumor tissues of patients with ESCC and in ESCC cells using reverse 
      transcription‑quantitative PCR analysis. Gene microarray analysis was performed to 
      detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Based on the functional annotation 
      results, the effects of ectopic expression of MEG3 on cell growth, migration, 
      invasion and EMT were assessed. MEG3 expression level was found to be markedly lower 
      in tumor tissues and cells. Statistical analysis revealed that MEG3 expression was 
      significantly negatively associated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in 
      ESCC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization assay demonstrated that MEG3 was expressed 
      mainly in the nucleus. Ectopic expression of MEG3 inhibited cell proliferation, 
      migration, invasion and cell cycle progression in EC109 cells. Gene microarray 
      results demonstrated that 177 genes were differentially expressed ≥2.0 fold in 
      MEG3‑overexpressing cells, including 23 upregulated and 154 downregulated genes. 
      Functional annotation revealed that the DEGs were mainly involved in amino acid 
      biosynthetic process, mitogen‑activated protein kinase signaling, and serine and 
      glycine metabolism. Further experiments indicated that the ectopic expression of 
      MEG3 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT by 
      downregulating phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1). In pathological tissues, 
      PSAT1 and MEG3 were significantly negatively correlated, and high expression of 
      PSAT1 predicted poor survival. Taken together, these results suggest that MEG3 may 
      be a useful prognostic biomarker and may suppress EMT by inhibiting the 
      PSAT1‑dependent glycogen synthase kinase‑3β/Snail signaling pathway in ESCC.

TI  - Long Non-Coding RNA MEG3 Functions as a Competing Endogenous RNA to Regulate HOXA11 
      Expression by Sponging miR-181a in Multiple Myeloma.
PG  - 87-100
LID - 10.1159/000492846 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) has been 
      reported to play an essential role in cancer progression and metastasis. However, 
      the overall biological role and regulatory mechanism of MEG3 in multiple myeloma 
      (MM) development and progression remains largely ill-defined. METHODS: MEG3 and 
      miR-181a expression of MM patients were analyzed by publicly available MM data sets. 
      Cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry analysis were used to identify the function 
      of MEG3 on MM in vitro. Additionally, we conducted tumor formation experiments in 
      mice models to explain the role of MEG3 on MM in vivo. Then, several mechanism 
      experiments, including dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation 
      were performed to evaluate the emulative relationship between MEG3 and miR-181a. 
      RESULTS: In this research, we found that MEG3 was downregulated in MM patients, 
      which was linked with tumor progression. In addition, we demonstrated that miR-181a 
      was overexpressed in MM patients in consistent with its cancer-promoting function. 
      Importantly, several mechanism experiments revealed that MEG3, acting as an 
      endogenous competitive RNA, could contend with miR-181a to inhibit tumor 
      progression. Furthermore, as the target mRNA of miR-181a, homeobox gene A11(HOXA11) 
      could be positively regulated by MEG3 through sponging miR-181a competitively in 
      vitro. CONCLUSION: Our present work supplies the first discovery of a 
      MEG3/miR-181a/HOXA11 regulatory network in MM and highlights that MEG3 may serve as 
      a promising target for MM therapy in the future.

TI  - The Long Non-Coding RNA (lncRNA) AGAP2-AS1 is Upregulated in Ovarian Carcinoma and 
      Negatively Regulates lncRNA MEG3.
PG  - 4699-4704
LID - 10.12659/MSM.914766 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 has been reported to promote several types of cancers, 
      but its involvement in ovarian carcinoma (OC) is unknown. Our study was carried out 
      to investigate the potential involvement of AGAP2-AS1 in OC. MATERIAL AND METHODS We 
      enrolled 82 patients with ovarian carcinoma. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) 
      was performed to analyze lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 expression in ovarian carcinoma and 
      proliferation assays were performed. RESULTS We found AGAP2-AS1 was upregulated in 
      OC tissues compared to adjacent healthy tissues, and expression levels of AGAP2-AS1 
      increased with increased clinical stages. lncRNA MEG3 was downregulated in OC 
      tissues and was inversely correlated with AGAP2-AS1. AGAP2-AS1 overexpression led to 
      downregulation of MEG3, while MEG3 overexpression failed to affect AGAP2-AS1. 
      AGAP2-AS1 overexpression promoted proliferation of OC cells, while MEG3 
      overexpression inhibited proliferation of OC cells. In addition, MEG3 overexpression 
      attenuated the effects of AGAP2-AS1 overexpression on cancer cell proliferation, but 
      AGAP2-AS1 overexpression did not obviously affect cancer cell invasion and 
      migration. CONCLUSIONS lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 is upregulated in ovarian carcinoma and 
      negatively regulates lncRNA MEG3 to participate in the regulation of cancer cell 
      proliferation.

TI  - Long Noncoding RNA MEG3 Is an Epigenetic Determinant of Oncogenic Signaling in 
      Functional Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Cells.
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00278-17 [doi]
LID - e00278-17
AB  - The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MEG3 is significantly downregulated in pancreatic 
      neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). MEG3 loss corresponds with aberrant upregulation of 
      the oncogenic hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor c-MET in PNETs. Meg3 
      overexpression in a mouse insulin-secreting PNET cell line, MIN6, downregulates 
      c-Met expression. However, the molecular mechanism by which MEG3 regulates c-MET is 
      not known. Using chromatin isolation by RNA purification and sequencing (ChIRP-Seq), 
      we identified Meg3 binding to unique genomic regions in and around the c-Met gene. 
      In the absence of Meg3, these c-Met regions displayed distinctive enhancer-signature 
      histone modifications. Furthermore, Meg3 relied on functional enhancer of zeste 
      homolog 2 (EZH2), a component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), to inhibit 
      c-Met expression. Another mechanism of lncRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression 
      utilized triplex-forming GA-GT rich sequences. Transfection of such motifs from Meg3 
      RNA, termed triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs), in MIN6 cells suppressed c-Met 
      expression and enhanced cell proliferation, perhaps by modulating other targets. 
      This study comprehensively establishes epigenetic mechanisms underlying Meg3 control 
      of c-Met and the oncogenic consequences of Meg3 loss or c-Met gain. These findings 
      have clinical relevance for targeting c-MET in PNETs. There is also the potential 
      for pancreatic islet β-cell expansion through c-MET regulation to ameliorate β-cell 
      loss in diabetes.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancers among men worldwide, and 
      advanced PCs, such as locally advanced PC (LAPC) and castration-resistant PC (CRPC), 
      present the greatest challenges in clinical management. Current indicators have 
      limited capacity to predict the disease course; therefore, better prognostic markers 
      are greatly needed. In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The 
      Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets, including RNA-Seq data from the prostate 
      adenocarcinoma (PRAD; n = 55) and West Coast Dream Team - metastatic CRPC 
      (WCDT-MCRPC; n = 84) projects, to evaluate the transcriptome changes associated with 
      progression-free survival (PFS) for LAPC and CRPC, respectively. We identified the 
      genes whose expression was positively/negatively correlated with PFS. In LAPC, the 
      genes with the most significant negative correlations were ZC2HC1A, SQLE, and KIF11, 
      and the genes with the most significant positive correlations were SOD3, LRRC26, 
      MIR22HG, MEG3, and MIR29B2CHG. In CRPC, the most significant positive correlations 
      were found for BET1, CTAGE5, IFNGR1, and GIMAP6, and the most significant negative 
      correlations were found for CLPB, PRPF19, ZNF610, MPST, and LINC02001. In addition, 
      we performed a gene network interaction analysis using STRINGdb, which revealed a 
      significant relationship between genes predominantly involved in the cell cycle and 
      characterized by upregulated expression in early recurrence. Based on the results, 
      we propose several genes that can be used as potential prognostic markers.

AB  - Macrophage polarization is a process through which macrophages attain unique 
      functional features as a response to certain stimuli from their niche. 
      Lipopolysaccharide and Th1 cytokines induce generation of M1 macrophages. On the 
      other hand, IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, IL-33, and TGF-β induce polarization of macrophages 
      towards M2 phenotype. This process is also modulated by a number of miRNAs and 
      lncRNAs. miR-375, miR-let7, miR-34a, miR-155, miR-124, miR-34a, miR-511-3p, miR-99a, 
      miR-132 and miR-145-3p are among miRNAs that regulate macrophage polarization. 
      Meanwhile, macrophage polarization is influenced by some lncRNAs such as H19, NRON, 
      MEG3, GAS5, RN7SK, and AK085865. Macrophage polarization has functional significance 
      in a wide range of human disorders particularly immune disorders and cancer. In 
      addition, the effect of certain drugs in modulation of macrophage polarization is 
      exerted through modulation of expression of non-coding RNAs. In the current 
      manuscript, we provide a summary of studies aimed to identification of this aspect 
      of non-coding RNAs.

TI  - Lidocaine inhibits cervical cancer cell proliferation and induces cell apoptosis by 
      modulating the lncRNA-MEG3/miR-421/BTG1 pathway.
PG  - 5404-5416
AB  - This study aimed to explore the effect of lidocaine on the growth of cervical cancer 
      cells (HeLa) and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) 
      and flow cytometry (FCM) were used to detect the cell viability and apoptosis of 
      cervical cancer cells after lidocaine treatment. Lidocaine inhibited cell viability 
      and promoted apoptosis in HeLa cells. Long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 
      (lncRNA-MEG3) was significantly downregulated in cervical cancer cells, and 
      lidocaine increased the expression of lncRNA-MEG3 in HeLa cells. Quantitative 
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), CCK-8, and FCM assays 
      were used to test indicators. MEG3-shRNA promoted the cell viability and inhibited 
      apoptosis, while the effect of lidocaine was the opposite. The effects of lidocaine 
      on HeLa cells were reversed by MEG3-shRNA. The level of miR-421 in cervical cancer 
      and normal cervical cells was detected using qRT-PCR. The MEG3-plasmid could inhibit 
      cell viability and induce cell apoptosis, but these effects were reversed by miR-421 
      upregulation. Hence, lidocaine suppressed tumor growth by regulating cell viability 
      and inducing apoptosis. The results indicated that BTG anti-proliferation factor 1 
      (BTG1) was a direct target of miR-421. HeLa cells were transfected with inhibitor 
      control, miR-421 inhibitor, control-shRNA, or BTG1-shRNA. The negative effects of 
      the miR-421 inhibitor or knockdown BTG1 on cell viability and apoptosis were 
      identified using CCK-8 assay and FCM. The miR-421 inhibitor improved cervical cancer 
      progression by regulating BTG1 expression. The results suggested that lidocaine 
      inhibited the growth of cervical cancer cells by modulating the 
      lncRNA-MEG3/miR-421/BTG1 signaling pathway, providing opportunities for treating 
      cervical cancer.

TI  - LncRNA MEG3 suppresses migration and promotes apoptosis by sponging miR-548d-3p to 
      modulate JAK-STAT pathway in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 882-890
LID - 10.1002/iub.2012 [doi]
AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a lethal malignancy and its prognosis remains 
      dismal. Thus, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms is needed to provide a new 
      insight for new therapies. It has been reported that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) 
      maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) was downregulated in OSCC tissues, however, its 
      functional mechanism remains uncertain. Here, we found that the overexpression of 
      MEG3 suppressed migration and promoted apoptosis in OSCC cell lines, while 
      inhibition of MEG3 exhibited opposite effect. We also found that MEG3 could 
      effectively sponge miR-548d-3p and decrease its expression level. Moreover, 
      miR-548d-3p repressed the expression of SOCS5 and SOCS6 through binding their 3'UTR, 
      thereby modulating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and functioning as an oncogene in 
      OSCC cells. Importantly, overexpression of MEG3 enhanced the expression of SOCS5 and 
      SOCS6 to regulate JAK-STAT pathway, whereas miR-548d-3p overexpression decreased the 
      effects of MEG3 on levels of SOCS5/SOCS6. Furthermore, upregulated expression of 
      miR-548d-3p could abrogate the effect of MEG3 overexpression on migration and 
      apoptosis in OSCC cell lines. In addition, the overexpression of MEG3 inhibited 
      tumor migration and facilitated apoptosis in vivo. Together, our results revealed 
      that MEG3 could modulate JAK-STAT pathway via miR-548d-3p/SOCS5/SOCS6 to suppresses 
      migration and promote apoptosis in OSCC. Our research indexed a new functional 
      mechanism of MEG3 in OSCC, and this mechanism may be a potential prognostic factor 
      and therapeutic target. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 2019.

TI  - Essential Role of the 14q32 Encoded miRNAs in Endocrine Tumors.
LID - 10.3390/genes12050698 [doi]
LID - 698
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 14q32 cluster is among the largest polycistronic miRNA clusters. 
      miRNAs encoded here have been implicated in tumorigenesis of multiple organs 
      including endocrine glands. METHODS: Critical review of miRNA studies performed in 
      endocrine tumors have been performed. The potential relevance of 14q32 miRNAs 
      through investigating their targets, and integrating the knowledge provided by 
      literature data and bioinformatics predictions have been indicated. RESULTS: 
      Pituitary adenoma, papillary thyroid cancer and a particular subset of 
      pheochromocytoma and adrenocortical cancer are characterized by the downregulation 
      of miRNAs encoded by the 14q32 cluster. Pancreas neuroendocrine tumors, most of the 
      adrenocortical cancer and medullary thyroid cancer are particularly distinct, as 
      14q32 miRNAs were overexpressed. In pheochromocytoma and growth-hormone producing 
      pituitary adenoma, however, both increased and decreased expression of 14q32 miRNAs 
      cluster members were observed. In the background of this phenomenon methodological, 
      technical and biological factors are hypothesized and discussed. The functions of 
      14q32 miRNAs were also revealed by bioinformatics and literature data mining. 
      CONCLUSIONS: 14q32 miRNAs have a significant role in the tumorigenesis of endocrine 
      organs. Regarding their stable expression in the circulation of healthy individuals, 
      further investigation of 14q32 miRNAs could provide a potential for use as 
      biomarkers (diagnostic or prognostic) in endocrine neoplasms.

TI  - Long non‑coding RNA MEG3 inhibits cell migration and invasion of non‑small cell lung 
      cancer cells by regulating the miR‑21‑5p/PTEN axis.
LID - 191 [pii]
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2021.11830 [doi]
AB  - Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the occurrence and progression of 
      numerous types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of 
      the lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) on the migration and invasion of 
      non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H1299 and PC9 cells. Reverse 
      transcription‑quantitative (RT‑q)PCR analysis showed that MEG3 was downregulated in 
      NSCLC PC9 and H1299 cells. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis indicated that MEG3 
      sponges microRNA (miR)‑21‑5p; miR‑21‑5p was predicted to target the phosphatase and 
      tensin homolog (PTEN) 3'‑untranslated region sequence. MEG3 overexpression led to 
      miR‑21‑5p suppression and PTEN upregulation in PC9 and H1299 cells, as detected by 
      RT‑qPCR. Subsequently, western blot analysis confirmed that MEG3 overexpression 
      enhanced PTEN expression levels and inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in 
      NSCLC cells. These effects were attenuated by miR‑21‑5p. Dual luciferase assay 
      supported the sponging effect of MEG3 on miR‑21‑5p and validated the direct 
      interaction between miR‑21‑5p and PTEN. Furthermore, Transwell assay demonstrated 
      that MEG3 overexpression had an inhibitory effect on cell migration and invasion. 
      MEG3 overexpression also mediated epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition by 
      significantly enhancing E‑cadherin and decreasing N‑cadherin, Vimentin and matrix 
      metalloprotein 9 expression levels in NSCLC cells, as indicated by western blot 
      analysis. These changes were partially reversed by an miR‑21‑5p mimic. These results 
      indicated that MEG3 acted as a tumor suppressor that inhibited NSCLC cell migration 
      and invasion via sponging miR‑21‑5p, which, in turn, enhanced the expression levels 
      of PTEN, in part via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The results of the present 
      study have suggested the potential of MEG3 as a novel therapeutic target for NSCLC 
      treatment.

      neuroendocrine tumors.

AB  - Biallelic inactivation of MEN1 encoding menin in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors 
      (PNETs) associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome is 
      well established, but how menin loss/inactivation initiates tumorigenesis is not 
      well understood. We show that menin activates the long noncoding RNA maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (Meg3) by histone-H3 lysine-4 trimethylation and CpG 
      hypomethylation at the Meg3 promoter CRE site, to allow binding of the transcription 
      factor cAMP response element-binding protein. We found that Meg3 has 
      tumor-suppressor activity in PNET cells because the overexpression of Meg3 in MIN6 
      cells (insulin-secreting mouse PNET cell line) blocked cell proliferation and 
      delayed cell cycle progression. Gene expression microarray analysis showed that Meg3 
      overexpression in MIN6 mouse insulinoma cells down-regulated the expression of the 
      protooncogene c-Met (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), and these cells showed 
      significantly reduced cell migration/invasion. Compared with normal islets, mouse or 
      human MEN1-associated PNETs expressed less MEG3 and more c-MET. Therefore, a 
      tumor-suppressor long noncoding RNA (MEG3) and suppressed protooncogene (c-MET) 
      combination could elicit menin's tumor-suppressor activity. Interestingly, MEG3 and 
      c-MET expression was also altered in human sporadic insulinomas (insulin secreting 
      PNETs) with hypermethylation at the MEG3 promoter CRE-site coinciding with reduced 
      MEG3 expression. These data provide insights into the β-cell proliferation 
      mechanisms that could retain their functional status. Furthermore, in MIN6 mouse 
      insulinoma cells, DNA-demethylating drugs blocked cell proliferation and activated 
      Meg3 expression. Our data suggest that the epigenetic activation of lncRNA MEG3 
      and/or inactivation of c-MET could be therapeutic for treating PNETs and 
      insulinomas.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the utmost deadly human malignancies. This 
      type of cancer has been associated with several environmental, viral, and lifestyle 
      risk factors. Among the epigenetic factors which contribute in the pathogenesis of 
      HCC is dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). These transcripts modulate 
      expression of several tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes and alter the activity of 
      cancer-related signaling axes. Several lncRNAs such as NEAT1, MALAT1, ANRIL, and 
      SNHG1 have been up-regulated in HCC samples. On the other hand, a number of 
      so-called tumor suppressor lncRNAs namely CASS2 and MEG3 are down-regulated in HCC. 
      The interaction between lncRNAs and miRNAs regulate expression of a number of mRNA 
      coding genes which are involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. H19/miR-15b/CDC42, 
      H19/miR-326/TWIST1, NEAT1/miR-485/STAT3, MALAT1/miR-124-3p/Slug, 
      MALAT1/miR-195/EGFR, MALAT1/miR-22/SNAI1, and ANRIL/miR-144/PBX3 axes are among 
      functional axes in the pathobiology of HCC. Some genetic polymorphisms within 
      non-coding regions of the genome have been associated with risk of HCC in certain 
      populations. In the current paper, we describe the recent finding about the impact 
      of lncRNAs in HCC.

AB  - Muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer have an extremely poor 5-year survival 
      rate of 5%. In comparison, all other bladder cancers (BCs) have a 5-year survival 
      rate of 77%. This striking contrast indicates that one of the therapeutic kernels 
      for bladder cancer is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its 
      invasiveness and metastasis. In the current study, we demonstrated that maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is significantly downregulated in human invasive bladder 
      cancers in comparison to non-invasive bladder cancers, and that ectopic expression 
      of MEG3 dramatically inhibits the invasiveness of human bladder cancer cells. 
      Consistently, ectopic expression of MEG3 also attenuates metastatic ability of T24T 
      cells, a cell line derived from T24 cells, in the lungs of nude mice. Our 
      mechanistic studies reveal that MEG3, as a ceRNA, inhibits the invasiveness of human 
      bladder cancer cells via negative regulation of c-Myc by competing with PHLPP2 mRNA 
      for miR-27a. These findings not only provide a novel insight into understanding the 
      mechanisms behind the MEG3 inhibition of bladder cancer cell invasion, but also 
      reveal the potential for use of MEG3 as a tool for the prevention and therapy of 
      invasive bladder cancer.

TI  - Long noncoding RNAs in osteosarcoma via various signaling pathways.
PG  - e23317
LID - 10.1002/jcla.23317 [doi]
LID - e23317
AB  - Osteosarcoma is one of the most commonly seen bone malignancies with high incidence 
      rate in both children and adults. Although the regulatory network of osteosarcoma 
      has been greatly concerned for years, the mechanisms regarding its oncogenesis and 
      development are still not clear. Recent discoveries have revealed that long 
      noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in the development, progression, and 
      invasion of osteosarcoma. Deregulated expression of lncRNAs has been found to 
      participate in the regulation of various signaling transduction pathways in 
      osteosarcoma. This review summarized roles of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis, 
      development, and potential therapeutic of osteosarcoma via different signaling 
      pathways. For examples, MALAT1, CCAT2, FER1L4, LOXL1-AS1, OIP5-AS1, PVT1, DBH-AS1, 
      and AWPPH regulate PI3K/Akt signaling; AWPPH and BE503655 regulate Wnt/β-catenin 
      signaling; NKILA and XIST regulate NF-κB signaling; MEG3 and SNHG12 regulate Notch 
      signaling; FOXD2-AS1 and LINK-A regulate HIF-1α signaling; GClnc1 and HOTAIR 
      regulate P53 signaling; ZFAS1, H19, and MALAT1 regulate MAPK, Hedgehog and Rac1/JNK 
      signaling, respectively.

TI  - MET/SMAD3/SNAIL circuit mediated by miR-323a-3p is involved in regulating 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition progression in bladder cancer.
PG  - e3010
LID - 10.1038/cddis.2017.331 [doi]
AB  - Bladder cancer (BCa) is the one of the most common cancers with high incidence, 
      occurrence and low 5-year survival rate. Emerging evidence indicates that DLK1-DIO3 
      genomic region especially the miRNA cluster in this region is involved in several 
      pathologic processes and various cancers, and miR-323a-3p is a member of this miRNA 
      cluster. In this study, we investigate the function and regulatory network of 
      miR-323a-3p in BCa. miR-323a-3p is frequently downregulated in BCa tissues and three 
      cell lines compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues and bladder normal cell line 
      (SV-HUC-1). Besides, downregulation of miR-323a-3p is significantly associated with 
      poor overall survival rate of BCa. Methylation of DLK1-MEG3 intergenic DMR (IG-DMR) 
      contributes to the reduction of miR-323a-3p. Overexpression of miR-323a-3p 
      significantly inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression of 
      BCa. Both upregulated MET and SMAD3 are direct targets of miR-323a-3p, and the 
      knockdown of MET and SMAD3 also represses the EMT progression consistently with 
      overexpression of miR-323a-3p. SNAIL is detected in the last targeted confocal 
      protein of both MET and SMAD3 signaling that trigger EMT consequently. Hence, a 
      miR-323a-3p/MET/SMAD3/SNAIL circuit is established to regulate the EMT progression 
      of BCa. And a mutual regulatory mechanism between miR-323a-3p/miR-433/miR-409 and 
      MET also participates in this circuit. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a novel 
      regulatory mechanism of the miR-323a-3p/MET/SMAD3/SNAIL circuit that is involved in 
      the EMT regulation of BCa, which may be a potential therapy target for BCa.

TI  - Cadmium exposure and MEG3 methylation differences between Whites and African 
      Americans in the NEST Cohort.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant associated with a wide range of 
      health outcomes including cancer. However, obscure exposure sources often hinder 
      prevention efforts. Further, although epigenetic mechanisms are suspected to link 
      these associations, gene sequence regions targeted by Cd are unclear. Aberrant 
      methylation of a differentially methylated region (DMR) on the MEG3 gene that 
      regulates the expression of a cluster of genes including MEG3, DLK1, MEG8, MEG9 and 
      DIO3 has been associated with multiple cancers. In 287 infant-mother pairs, we used 
      a combination of linear regression and the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic to determine if 
      maternal blood Cd concentrations were associated with offspring CpG methylation of 
      the sequence region regulating a cluster of imprinted genes including MEG3. 
      Correlations were used to examine potential sources and routes. We observed a 
      significant geographic co-clustering of elevated prenatal Cd levels and MEG3 DMR 
      hypermethylation in cord blood (P = 0.01), and these findings were substantiated in 
      our statistical models (β = 1.70, se = 0.80, P = 0.03). These associations were 
      strongest in those born to African American women (β = 3.52, se = 1.32, P = 0.01) 
      compared with those born to White women (β = 1.24, se = 2.11, P = 0.56) or Hispanic 
      women (β = 1.18, se = 1.24, P = 0.34). Consistent with Cd bioaccumulation during the 
      life course, blood Cd levels increased with age (β = 0.015 µg/dl/year, P = 0.003), 
      and Cd concentrations were significantly correlated between blood and urine 
      (ρ > 0.47, P < 0.01), but not hand wipe, soil or house dust concentrations 
      (P > 0.05). Together, these data support that prenatal Cd exposure is associated 
      with aberrant methylation of the imprint regulatory element for the MEG3 gene 
      cluster at birth. However, neither house-dust nor water are likely exposure sources, 
      and ingestion via contaminated hands is also unlikely to be a significant exposure 
      route in this population. Larger studies are required to identify routes and sources 
      of exposure.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to compete 
      with microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer occurrence and development. However, the 
      differential expression of RNAs and their ceRNA network during the development of 
      colon cancer (CC) remains unclear. This study was aimed at comprehensive analysis of 
      the lncRNAs and their ceRNA networks associated with CC. Whole transcriptome 
      sequencing was performed on colorectal and adjacent normal tissues at different 
      pathological stages. Forty-nine lncRNAs were differently expressed between the CC 
      tissues and their adjacent normal tissues at all stages. Aberrant expression of 
      lncRNA CDKN2B-AS1 and lncRNA MIR4435-2HG was confirmed by TCGA database. Moreover, 
      14 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between early and advance stages of the 
      tumor tissues, and 117 miRNAs were specifically expressed in stage III & IV. 
      Weighted gene co-expression network analysis of 17105 differently expressed mRNAs 
      revealed that the mRNAs shown in module pink, midnight blue, black, and light cyan 
      were related to TNM and pathological stage, and that these mRNAs were enriched in 
      cancer related functions and pathways. As DElncRNA showed a trend of change similar 
      to that of the DEmRNA and opposite to that of DEmiRNA, ceRNA network was constructed 
      with 3 DEmiRNAs, 5 DElncRNAs, and 130 DEmRNAs. Real time PCR revealed that 
      expression of MEG3 was decreased in the tumor tissues belonging to stage III and IV 
      as compared to that in stage I. Moreover, hsa-miR-324-5p was upregulated, while 
      FGFR3, PLCB4, and IKBKB were downregulated in the tumor tissues as compared to that 
      in the adjacent normal tissues. Thus, this study revealed differentially expressed 
      lncRNA between different stages of CC as well as suggested that lncRNA CDKN2B-AS1, 
      MIR4435-2HG, and MEG3 may act as diagnostic biomarkers for the development of CC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reports have demonstrated the prognostic function of long non-coding 
      RNAS (lncRNAS) in patients with cancer. However, their prognostic functions in non 
      small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain controversial. We therefore performed a 
      meta-analysis on six lncRNAs (PVT1, AFAP1-AS1, LINC01133, ANRIL, MEG3 and UCA1) to 
      clarify their prognostic roles in NSCLC. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies involving 6267 
      patients with NSCLC and 34 lncRNAs were included. Of the listed lncRNAs, 20 were 
      shown to negatively affect patients' overall survival while the high expression of 
      13 lncRNAs indicated better survival outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The log-rank p 
      value and Kaplan-Meier survival curves of survival outcomes were extracted for 
      hazard ratio (HR) calculation. Survival outcomes were measured by overall survival 
      (OS) and event free survival (EFS) which were then analyzed by calculating pooled 
      hazard ratios. The heterogeneity was detected by Q statistic and I-squared 
      statistic. CONCLUSIONS: The abnormal expression of lncRNAs may significantly affect 
      NSCLC patients' survival and may serve as a novel predictive factor for prognosis of 
      NSCLC patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs plays an important role in chronic myeloid 
      leukemia (CML). In this study, we aimed to uncover the mechanism of the lncRNA 
      maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) and its target microRNA-147 (miR-147) in CML. METHODS: 
      Sixty CML patients and 10 healthy donors were included in the study. The methylation 
      of MEG3 and miR-147 promoter was determined by methylation-specific PCR. The 
      relationship of MEG3 and miR-147 was explored by luciferase assay. The interactions 
      of proteins were studied by RNA pull-down assay, RNA immunoprecipitation and 
      co-immunoprecipitation. FINDINGS: Patients in accelerated phase CML (CML-AP) and 
      blast phase CML (CML-BP) showed lower expressions of MEG3 and miR-147 and higher 
      expressions of DNMT1, DNMT3B, MBD2, MECP2 and HDAC1 compared to the controls. These 
      patients also showed a higher degree of methylation of MEG3 and miR-147 while there 
      was a reduction after chidamide treatment. Furthermore, the overexpression of MEG3 
      and miR-147 inhibited cell proliferation both in vivo and in vitro, promoted 
      apoptosis and decreased the expressions of DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, MBD2, HDAC1 and 
      MECP2. We also found MEG3 interacted with DNMT1, JAK2, STAT3, HDAC1, and TYK2, and 
      JAK2 was bound to STAT3, STAT5 and MYC. More interestingly, JAK2 was bound to TYK2 
      by the bridge of MEG3. INTERPRETATION: LncRNA MEG3 and its target miR-147 may serve 
      as a novel therapeutic target for CML blast crisis, and chidamide might have a 
      potential clinical application in treating CML blast crisis.

TI  - Exosomal Long Noncoding RNAs are Differentially Expressed in the Cervicovaginal 
      Lavage Samples of Cervical Cancer Patients.
PG  - 1116-1121
LID - 10.1002/jcla.21990 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the second leading cause of cancer morbidity and death in women, 
      cervical cancer remains an important public health problem worldwide. Novel 
      biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity for the early detection and 
      diagnosis of cervical cancer are urgently needed. Increasing evidence shows that 
      long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are differentially expressed in cancer tissues and may 
      serve as diagnostic markers. In multiple tumor types, exosomes harboring lncRNAs are 
      actively released from tumor cells. In this study, we investigate the potential 
      association of exosomal lncRNA expression with cervical cancer. METHODS: 
      Cervicovaginal lavage specimens were collected from patients with cervical cancer 
      and cancer-free volunteers who are HPV-positive or HPV-negative. Exosomes in these 
      specimens were isolated by ultracentrifugation and confirmed by transmission 
      electron microscopy. The exosomal lncRNAs HOTAIR, MALAT1, and MEG3 were quantified 
      by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Expression of HOTAIR, MALAT1 and MEG3 was predominantly 
      observed in cervical cancer-derived exosomes in cervicovaginal lavage samples. The 
      expression levels of lncRNAs were significantly different in exosomes isolated from 
      cervical cancer patients compared to normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest 
      that lncRNAs in exosomes isolated from cervicovaginal lavage are differentially 
      expressed in cervical cancer patients and cancer-free volunteers. Exosomal lncRNAs 
      may have great potential to be used for the early detection and diagnosis of 
      cervical cancer, and serve as convenient and noninvasive biomarkers.

PG  - 11680-7
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i41.11680 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have showed that RNAs regulate each other with microRNA (miRNA) 
      response elements (MREs) and this mechanism is known as "competing endogenous RNA 
      (ceRNA)" hypothesis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are supposed to play important 
      roles in cancer. Compelling evidence suggests that lncRNAs can interact with miRNAs 
      and regulate the expression of miRNAs as ceRNAs. Several lncRNAs such as H19, HOTAIR 
      and MEG3 have been found to be associated with miRNAs in gastric cancer (GC), 
      generating regulatory crosstalk across the transcriptome. These MRE sharing elements 
      implicated in the ceRNA networks (ceRNETs) are able to regulate mRNA expression. The 
      ceRNA regulatory networks including mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs and circular RNAs may 
      play critical roles in tumorigenesis, and the perturbations of ceRNETs may 
      contribute to the pathogenesis of GC.

TI  - Combined molecular and mathematical analysis of long noncoding RNAs expression in 
      fine needle aspiration biopsies as novel tool for early diagnosis of thyroid cancer.
PG  - 711-720
LID - 10.1007/s12020-020-02508-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In presence of indeterminate lesions by fine needle aspiration (FNA), 
      thyroid cancer cannot always be easily diagnosed by conventional cytology. As a 
      consequence, unnecessary removal of thyroid gland is performed in patients without 
      cancer based on the lack of optimized diagnostic criteria. Aim of this study is 
      identifying a molecular profile based on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression 
      capable to discriminate between benign and malignant nodules. METHODS: Patients were 
      subjected to surgery (n = 19) for cytologic suspicious thyroid nodules or to FNA 
      biopsy (n = 135) for thyroid nodules suspicious at ultrasound. Three 
      thyroid-specific genes (TG, TPO, and NIS), six cancer-associated lncRNAs (MALAT1, 
      NEAT1, HOTAIR, H19, PVT1, MEG3), and two housekeeping genes (GAPDH and P0) were 
      analyzed using Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR). RESULTS: Based on higher co-expression 
      in malignant (n = 11) but not in benign (n = 8) nodules after surgery, MALAT1, PVT1 
      and HOTAIR were selected as putative cancer biomarkers to analyze 135 FNA samples. 
      Cytological and histopathological data from a subset of FNA patients (n = 34) were 
      used to define a predictive algorithm based on a Naïve Bayes classifier using 
      co-expression of MALAT1, PVT1, HOTAIR, and cytological class. This classifier 
      exhibited a significant separation capability between malignant and benign nodules 
      (P < 0.0001) as well as both rule in and rule out test potential with an accuracy of 
      94.12% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% and a positive predictive value 
      (PPV) of 91.67%. CONCLUSIONS: ddPCR analysis of selected lncRNAs in FNA biopsies 
      appears a suitable molecular tool with the potential of improving diagnostic 
      accuracy.

AB  - Expression of 14q32-encoded miRNAs is a favorable prognostic factor in patients with 
      metastatic cancer. In this study, we used genomic inhibition of DNA methylation 
      through disruption of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B and pharmacologic 
      inhibition with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC, decitabine) to demonstrate that 
      DNA methylation predominantly regulates expression of metastasis-suppressive miRNAs 
      in the 14q32 cluster. DNA demethylation facilitated CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) 
      recruitment to the maternally expressed gene 3 differentially methylated region 
      (MEG3-DMR), which acts as a cis-regulatory element for 14q32 miRNA expression. 
      5-Aza-dC activated demethylation of the MEG3-DMR and expression of 14q32 miRNAs, 
      which suppressed adhesion, invasion, and migration (AIM) properties of metastatic 
      tumor cells. Cancer cells with MEG3-DMR hypomethylation exhibited constitutive 
      expression of 14q32 miRNAs and resistance to 5-Aza-dC-induced suppression of AIM. 
      Expression of methylation-dependent 14q32 miRNAs suppressed metastatic colonization 
      in preclinical models of lung and liver metastasis and correlated with improved 
      clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic cancer. These findings implicate 
      epigenetic modification via DNA methylation in the regulation of metastatic 
      propensity through miRNA networks and identify a previously unrecognized action of 
      decitabine on the activation of metastasis-suppressive miRNAs. SIGNIFICANCE: This 
      study investigates epigenetic regulation of metastasis-suppressive miRNAs and the 
      effect on metastasis.

TI  - Long non-coding RNA MEG3 functions as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate gastric 
      cancer progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as important 
      regulators in governing fundamental biological processes, and many of which are 
      likely to have functional roles in tumorigenesis. Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) 
      gene encodes a lncRNA whose expression is lost in an expanding list of primary human 
      tumors and tumor cell lines, however its biological role and regulatory mechanism in 
      gastric cancer (GC) development and progression are poorly defined. METHODS: 
      Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to determine whether aberrant MEG3 expression 
      was associated with GC patients pTNM stage and pM state. Furthermore, the effect of 
      ectopic expression of MEG3 on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and cell 
      apoptosis was assessed by using CCK-8, wound healing, transwell invasion assays and 
      flow cytometric analysis, respectively, in GC cell lines HGC-27 and MGC-803. 
      Moreover, the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) activity of MEG3 on miR-181a was 
      investigated via luciferase reporter assay and immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: MEG3 is 
      decreased in GC patients and cell lines, and its expression was associated with 
      metastatic GC. Furthermore, ectopic expression of MEG3 in HGC-27 and MGC-803 cells 
      inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis, 
      which might be due to MEG3 sequestering oncogenic miR-181 s in GC cells. 
      Furthermore, MEG3 could up-regulated Bcl-2 via its competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) 
      activity on miR-181a. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that lncRNA MEG3, a ceRNA 
      of miR-181 s, could regulate gastric carcinogenesis and may serve as a potential 
      target for antineoplastic therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer with high mortality 
      rate and poor prognosis. lncRNA MEG3, a tumor suppressor, is closely related to the 
      development of various cancers. However, the role of lncRNA MEG3 in melanoma has 
      seldom been studied. METHODS: RT-PCR was used to examine the expressions of lncRNA 
      MEG3 and E-cadherin in melanoma patients and cell lines. Then, the biological 
      functions of lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin were demonstrated by transfecting lncRNA 
      MEG3-siRNA, lncRNA MEG3-overexpression, E-cadherin-siRNA and 
      E-cadherin-overexpression plasmids in melanoma cell lines. Moreover, CCK8 assay and 
      colony formation assay were utilized to assess the cell proliferation; Transwell 
      assay was performed to evaluate the cell invasive ability; and tumor xenografts in 
      nude mice were applied to test the tumor generation. Additionally, the target 
      interactions among lncRNA MEG3, miR-21 and E-cadherin were determined by dual 
      luciferase reporter assay. Finally, RT-PCR and WB were further conducted to verify 
      the regulatory roles among lncRNA MEG3, miR-21 and E-cadherin. RESULTS: The clinical 
      data showed that lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin expressions were both declined in 
      carcinoma tissues as compared with their para-carcinoma tissues. Moreover, lncRNA 
      MEG3 and E-cadherin expressions in B16 cells were also higher than those in A375 and 
      A2058 cells. Subsequently, based on the differently expressed lncRNA MEG3 and 
      E-cadherin in these human melanoma cell lines, we chose B16, A375 and A2058 cells 
      for the following experiments. The results demonstrated that lncRNA MEG3 could 
      suppress the tumor growth, tumor metastasis and formation; and meanwhile E-cadherin 
      had the same effects on tumor growth, tumor metastasis and formation. Furthermore, 
      the analysis of Kaplan-Meier curves also confirmed that there was a positive 
      correlation between lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin. Ultimately, dual luciferase assays 
      were further used to verify that lncRNA MEG3 could directly target miR-21 which 
      could directly target E-cadherin in turn. Additionally, the data of RT-PCR and WB 
      revealed that knockdown of lncRNA MEG3 in B16 cells inhibited miR-21 expression and 
      promoted E-cadherin expression, but overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 in A375 and A2058 
      cells presented completely opposite results. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that 
      lncRNA MEG3 might inhibit the tumor growth, tumor metastasis and formation of 
      melanoma by modulating miR-21/E-cadherin axis.

      analyses were performed on GSCs and GBM tissues. Methylation analyses, gene 
      expression, and reverse-phase protein array profiles were used to investigate the 
      tumor suppressor function of the maternally expressed 3 gene (MEG3). RESULTS: Loss 
      of expression of genes and noncoding RNAs within the DLK1-DIO3 region was observed 
      in GSCs and GBM tissues compared with normal brain. This downregulation is mainly 
      mediated by epigenetic silencing. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that low 
      expression of MEG3 and MEG8 long noncoding (lnc)RNAs significantly correlated with 
      short survival in GBM patients. MEG3 restoration impairs tumorigenic abilities of 
      GSCs in vitro by inhibiting cell growth, migration, and colony formation and 
      decreases in vivo tumor growth, reducing infiltrative growth. These effects were 
      associated with modulation of genes involved in cell adhesion and 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CONCLUSION: In GBM, MEG3 acts as a tumor 
      suppressor mainly regulating cell adhesion, EMT, and cell proliferation, thus 
      providing a potential candidate for novel GBM therapies.

AB  - Notch pathway is a signaling cascade with important impacts on cell proliferation, 
      differentiation, developmental processes and tissue homeostasis. This pathway also 
      regulates stem cell properties, thus being involved in both normal developmental 
      processes and metastatic capacity of cancer cells. Lots of lncRNAs and miRNAs have 
      been recognized that control Notch pathway at some levels or their expression is 
      regulated by this pathway. FOXD2-AS1, MEG3, ANRIL, linc-OIP5, lincRNA-p21, CBR3-AS1, 
      HOTAIR, PVT1 and GAS5 are among lncRNAs that interact with Notch signaling. miR-19, 
      miR-21, miR-33a, miR-8/200, miR-34a, miR-146a, miR-37, miR-100, miR-107 and several 
      other miRNAs have functional interplay with this signaling cascade. In the present 
      review article, we have illuminated the interplay between lncRNAs/miRNAs and Notch 
      pathway in two distinct contexts i.e. cancers and non-neoplastic conditions.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are 
      non-coding transcripts which are involved in the pathogenesis of pituitary gland 
      tumors. LncRNAs that participate in the pathogenesis of pituitary gland tumors 
      mainly serve as sponges for miRNAs. CLRN1-AS1/miR-217, XIST/miR-424-5p, H19/miR-93a, 
      LINC00473/miR-502-3p, SNHG7/miR-449a, MEG8/miR-454-3p, MEG3/miR-23b-3p, 
      MEG3/miR-376B-3P, SNHG6/miR-944, PCAT6/miR-139-3p, lncRNA-m433s1/miR-433, 
      TUG1/miR-187-3p, SNHG1/miR-187-3p, SNHG1/miR-302, SNHG1/miR-372, SNHG1/miR-373, and 
      SNHG1/miR-520 are identified lncRNA/miRNA pairs that are involved in this process. 
      Hsa_circ_0001368 and circOMA1 are two examples of circRNAs that contribute to the 
      pathogenesis of pituitary gland tumors. Meanwhile, SNHG1, LINC00702, LINC00460, and 
      MEG3 have been found to partake in the pathogenesis of meningioma. In the current 
      review, we describe the role of non-coding RNAs in two types of brain tumors, i.e., 
      pituitary tumors and meningioma.

TI  - Long Non-coding RNAs and their Role in Metastasis.
PG  - 143-160
AB  - The perception of long non-coding RNAs as chunk RNA and transcriptional noise has 
      been steadily replaced by their role as validated targets for a diverse set of 
      physiological processes in the past few years. However, for the vast majority of 
      lncRNAs their precise mode of action and physiological function remain to be 
      uncovered. A large body of evidence has revealed their essential role in all stages 
      of cancirogenesis and metastasis. In this review we focus on the role of lncRNAs in 
      metastasis. We grouped selected lncRNAs into three categories based on in vitro and 
      in vivo mode of action-related studies and clinical relevance for metastasis. 
      Grouped according to their mode of action, in category I we discuss lncRNAs such as 
      CCAT2, DREH, LET, NKILA, treRNA, HOTAIR, H19, FENDRR, lincROR, MALAT, GClnc1, BCAR4, 
      SCHLAP1 and lncRNA ATP, all lncRNAs with in vitro and in vivo metastasis-related 
      data and clinical significance. In category II we discuss lncRNAs CCAT1, PCAT1, 
      PTENgp1, GPLINC, MEG3, ZEB2-AS, LCT13, ANRIL, NBAT1 and lncTCF7 all characterized by 
      their mode of action in vitro and clinical significance, but pending or preliminary 
      in vivo data. Finally, under category III, we discuss lncRNAs BANCR, FRLnc1, 
      SPRY4-IT1 and LIMT with partially or poorly-resolved mode of action and varying 
      degree of validation in clinical metastasis. Finally we discuss metastasis-related 
      translational aspects of lncRNAs.

TI  - Expression of the lncRNA Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3) Contributes to the 
      Control of Lung Cancer Cell Proliferation by the Rb Pathway.
PG  - e0166363
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0166363 [doi]
LID - e0166363
AB  - Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3, mouse homolog Gtl2) encodes a long noncoding RNA 
      (lncRNA) that is expressed in many normal tissues, but is suppressed in various 
      cancer cell lines and tumors, suggesting it plays a functional role as a tumor 
      suppressor. Hypermethylation has been shown to contribute to this loss of 
      expression. We now demonstrate that MEG3 expression is regulated by the 
      retinoblastoma protein (Rb) pathway and correlates with a change in cell 
      proliferation. Microarray analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated 
      from mice with genetic deletion of all three Rb family members (TKO) revealed a 
      significant silencing of Gtl2/MEG3 expression compared to WT MEFs, and re-expression 
      of Gtl2/MEG3 caused decrease in cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. MEG3 
      levels also were suppressed in A549 lung cancer cells compared with normal human 
      bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, and, similar to the TKO cells, re-constitution of 
      MEG3 led to a decrease in cell proliferation and elevated apoptosis. Activation of 
      pRb by treatment of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells with palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, 
      increased the expression of MEG3 in a dose-dependent manner, while knockdown of 
      pRb/p107 attenuated this effect. In addition, expression of 
      phosphorylation-deficient mutant of pRb increased MEG3 levels in both lung cancer 
      cell types. Treatment of these cells with palbociclib also decreased the expression 
      of pRb-regulated DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), while conversely, knockdown of 
      DNMT1 resulted in increased expression of MEG3. As gene methylation has been 
      suggested for MEG3 regulation, we found that palbociclib resulted in decreased 
      methylation of the MEG3 locus similar to that observed with 5-aza-deoxycytidine. 
      Anti-sense oligonucleotide silencing of drug-induced MEG3 expression in A549 and 
      SK-MES-1 cells partially rescued the palbociclib-mediated decrease in cell 
      proliferation, while analysis of the TCGA database revealed decreased MEG3 
      expression in human lung tumors harboring a disrupted RB pathway. Together, these 
      data suggest that disruption of the pRb-DNMT1 pathway leads to a decrease in MEG3 
      expression, thereby contributing to the pro-proliferative state of certain cancer 
      cells.

AB  - Glioma is the most common malignant central nervous system tumor with significant 
      mortality and morbidity. Despite considerable advances, the exact molecular pathways 
      involved in tumor progression are not fully elucidated, and patients commonly face a 
      poor prognosis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently drawn extra attention 
      for their potential roles in different types of cancer as well as non-malignant 
      diseases. More than 200 lncRNAs have been reported to be associated with glioma. We 
      aimed to assess the roles of the most investigated lncRNAs in different stages of 
      tumor progression and the mediating molecular pathways in addition to their clinical 
      applications. lncRNAs are involved in different stages of tumor formation, invasion, 
      and progression, including regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, tumor stemness, angiogenesis, the integrity of 
      the blood-tumor-brain barrier, tumor metabolism, and immunological responses. The 
      well-known oncogenic lncRNAs, which are upregulated in glioma, are H19, HOTAIR, 
      PVT1, UCA1, XIST, CRNDE, FOXD2-AS1, ANRIL, HOXA11-AS, TP73-AS1, and DANCR. On the 
      other hand, MEG3, GAS5, CCASC2, and TUSC7 are tumor suppressor lncRNAs, which are 
      downregulated. While most studies reported oncogenic effects for MALAT1, TUG1, and 
      NEAT1, there are some controversies regarding these lncRNAs. Expression levels of 
      lncRNAs can be associated with tumor grade, survival, treatment response 
      (chemotherapy drugs or radiotherapy), and overall prognosis. Moreover, circulatory 
      levels of lncRNAs, such as MALAT1, H19, HOTAIR, NEAT1, TUG1, GAS5, LINK-A, and 
      TUSC7, can provide non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic tools. Modulation of 
      expression of lncRNAs using antisense oligonucleotides can lead to novel 
      therapeutics. Notably, a profound understanding of the underlying molecular pathways 
      involved in the function of lncRNAs is required to develop novel therapeutic 
      targets. More investigations with large sample sizes and increased focus on in-vivo 
      models are required to expand our understanding of the potential roles and 
      application of lncRNAs in glioma.

TI  - Meg3 Induces EMT and Invasion of Glioma Cells via Autophagy.
PG  - 989-1000

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioma is one of the most common malignant tumors. Glioblastoma (grade 
      IV) is considered the most malignant form of human brain tumors. Maternal expression 
      gene 3 (Meg3) encodes a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that plays an important role in the 
      development and progression of cancer. However, the role of Meg3 in glioma cells 
      remains largely unclear. METHODS: Reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q) PCR was 
      conducted to evaluate the mRNA expression related to cell autophagy and EMT while 
      protein expression was detected by Western blotting. Staining of acidic vacuoles and 
      immunofluorescence staining were used to detect autophagy. The ability of cells to 
      migrate and invade was detected by Transwell migration and invasion assays. RESULTS: 
      In the present study, it was found that the overexpression of Meg3 induced EMT, 
      migration and invasion of glioma cells, whereas Meg3 overexpression induced 
      autophagy of glioma cells. More importantly, the inhibition of autophagy impaired 
      the EMT of glioma cells. In addition, Meg3-induced EMT, migration and invasion could 
      be partially reversed by autophagy inhibitors, chloroquine (CQ) and Lys05, in glioma 
      cells. CONCLUSION: All data suggest that Meg3 induces EMT and invasion of glioma 
      cells via autophagy. Overall, the findings of the present study demonstrate the 
      importance of Meg3 in the molecular etiology of glioma, which also indicate its 
      potential applications in the treatment of glioma.

AB  - The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (Meg3) is encoded 
      within the imprinted Dlk1-Meg3 gene locus and is only maternally expressed. Meg3 has 
      been shown to play an important role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and 
      functions as a tumor suppressor in numerous tissues. Meg3 is highly expressed in 
      mouse adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and strongly down-regulated in early 
      progenitors. To address its functional role in HSCs, we used MxCre to conditionally 
      delete Meg3 in the adult bone marrow of Meg3(mat-flox/pat-wt) mice. We performed 
      extensive in vitro and in vivo analyses of mice carrying a Meg3 deficient blood 
      system, but neither observed impaired hematopoiesis during homeostatic conditions 
      nor upon serial transplantation. Furthermore, we analyzed VavCre 
      Meg3(mat-flox/pat-wt) mice, in which Meg3 was deleted in the embryonic hematopoietic 
      system and unexpectedly this did neither generate any hematopoietic defects. In 
      response to interferon-mediated stimulation, Meg3 deficient adult HSCs responded 
      highly similar compared to controls. Taken together, we report the finding, that the 
      highly expressed imprinted lncRNA Meg3 is dispensable for the function of HSCs 
      during homeostasis and in response to stress mediators as well as for serial 
      reconstitution of the blood system in vivo.

AB  - Over the past decade, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as 
      significant players in gene regulation. They are often differentially expressed and 
      widely-associated with a majority of cancer types. The aberrant expression of these 
      transcripts has been linked to tumorigenesis, metastasis, cancer stage progression 
      and patient survival. Despite their apparent link to cancer, it has been challenging 
      to gain a mechanistic understanding of how they contribute to cancer, partially due 
      the difficulty in discriminating functional RNAs from other noncoding transcription 
      events. However, there are several well-studied lncRNAs where specific mechanisms 
      have been more clearly defined, leading to new discoveries into how these RNAs 
      function. One major observation that has come to light is the context-dependence of 
      lncRNA mechanisms, where they often have unique function in specific cell types and 
      environment. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs with a focus on 
      cancer pathways, illustrating a few informative examples. Together, this type of 
      detailed insight will lead to a greater understanding of the potential for the 
      application of lncRNAs as targets of cancer therapies and diagnostics.

AB  - Non-coding RNAs such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have 
      been found to be indispensable factors in carcinogenesis and cancer development. 
      Numerous studies have explored the regulatory functions of these molecules and 
      identified the synergistic interactions among lncRNAs or miRNAs, while those between 
      lncRNAs and miRNAs remain to be investigated. In this study, we constructed and 
      characterized an lncRNA-miRNA synergistic network following a four-step approach by 
      integrating the regulatory pairs and expression profiles. The synergistic 
      interactions with more shared regulatory mRNAs were found to have higher 
      interactional intensity. Through the analysis of nodes in the network, we found that 
      lncRNAs played roles that are more central and had similar synergistic interactions 
      with their neighbors when compared with miRNAs. In addition, known colon 
      adenocarcinoma (COAD)-related RNAs were found to be enriched in this synergistic 
      network, with higher degrees, betweenness, and closeness. Finally, we proposed a 
      risk score model to predict the clinical outcome for COAD patients based on two 
      prognostic hub lncRNAs, MEG3 and ZEB1-AS1. Moreover, the hierarchical networks of 
      these two lncRNAs could contribute to the understanding of the biological mechanism 
      of tumorigenesis. For each lncRNA-miRNA interaction in the hub-related subnetwork 
      and two hierarchical networks, we performed RNAup method to evaluate their binding 
      energy. Our results identified two important lncRNAs with prognostic roles in colon 
      cancer and dissected their regulatory mechanism involving synergistic interaction 
      with miRNAs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) has been 
      identified to participate in the progression of malignant tumors. However, the role 
      and function of MEG3 in Wilms' tumor (WT) remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of this 
      study was to detect the role of MEG3 in the development of Wilms' tumor, and to 
      explore the underlying mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression of MEG3 in WT 
      tissues and blood samples were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The relationship between MEG3 level and 
      clinicopathological character and histogenesis was analyzed. WT-CLS1 and WiT49 cells 
      were cultured in vitro, and the influence of ectopic MEG3 expression was determined. 
      Colony formation assay and Edu assay were employed to measure cell proliferation, 
      while transwell assay and Matrigel assay were adopted to detect cell metastasis. 
      Furthermore, Western blot was applied to explore the mechanism of MEG3 in WT. 
      RESULTS: MEG3 was lowly expressed in WT tissues and blood samples (p<0.05). 
      Over-expression of MEG3 significantly reduced the proliferation, invasion and 
      migration of CLS1cells than control cells (p<0.05). However, inhibition of MEG3 in 
      WiT49 cells significantly promoted cell growth and metastasis compared with cells in 
      negative control group (p<0.05). In addition, MEG3 influenced the protein expression 
      of β-catenin by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. CONCLUSIONS: MEG3 was 
      low-expressed in WT tissues and blood samples. Meanwhile, it could inhibit the 
      proliferation and metastasis of WT cells via wt/β-catenin pathways. All our findings 
      indicated that MEG3 served as a potential target for the diagnosis, treatment and 
      prognosis prediction of WT.

TI  - Down-regulation of long non-coding RNA MEG3 serves as an unfavorable risk factor for 
      survival of patients with breast cancer.
PG  - 5143-5147
LID - 11924 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The downregulation of Long non-coding RNA MEG3 (MEG3) has been observed 
      in breast cancer (BC). However, there is no previous study of the relationship 
      between MEG3 and patient prognosis in BC. Accordingly, this study investigated the 
      prognostic values of MEG3 in BC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: we performed 
      RT-qPCR to detect the expression of MEG3 in 207 paired BC tissues and adjacent 
      noncancerous tissues. The association of MEG3 expression with clinicopathological 
      factors or prognosis was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that 
      the MEG3 expression was significantly decreased in clinical BC tissues compared to 
      adjacent normal tissues (p < 0.01). MEG3 level was significantly associated with 
      differentiation grade (p  = 0.004), TNM stage (p  = 0.011) and lymph nodes 
      metastasis (p  = 0.000). Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we found that patients with 
      low MEG3 expression had significantly poor overall survival (OS) rate (p  < 0.001) 
      and progression-free survival (PFS)  rate (p  < 0.001). Moreover, multivariate Cox 
      analysis revealed MEG3 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for both 
      5-year OS (p  = 0.003) and 5-year PFS (p  = 0.002) in BC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results indicated that MEG3 expression was an independent prognostic factor for 
      patients with BC, which may serve as a novel biomarker in BC patients.

TI  - m6A-Induced LncRNA MEG3 Suppresses the Proliferation, Migration and Invasion of 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Through miR-544b/BTG2 Signaling.
PG  - 3745-3755
LID - 10.2147/OTT.S289198 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant 
      tumors. Long non-coding RNA plays an important role in the development of HCC. This 
      study analyzed the impact of MEG3 on malignant behavior of HCC and explored its 
      possible molecular mechanism. METHODS: Expression of MEG3 in HCC tissues and cell 
      lines was measured by qRT-PCR. Transfection efficiency of MEG3 was verified by 
      qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation, transwell migration, invasion and cell cloning assays 
      were used to detect the effect of MEG3 on the proliferation, migration and invasion 
      ability of HCC cells. The bioinformatics analysis was applied to predict the binding 
      between miR-544b and MEG3 as well as BTG2. Luciferase reporter assay was performed 
      to verify their interaction. Finally, the m6A modification of MEG3 by METTL3 was 
      identified through RIP experiments. RESULTS: MEG3 was lowly expressed in HCC tissues 
      and cells. Overexpression of MEG3 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion 
      of HCC cells. MiR-544b can be sponged by MEG3, and overexpression of miR-544b 
      reverses the anti-cancer effect of MEG3. We further confirmed that BTG2 gene is the 
      target gene of miR-544b. Epigenetic studies have shown that METTL3-mediated 
      N(6)-methyladenosine modification led to MEG3 downregulation. CONCLUSION: In HCC, 
      MEG3 and BTG2 are lowly expressed while miR-544b is highly expressed. MEG3 regulates 
      the expression of BTG2 through miR-544b, thus affecting the malignant behavior of 
      HCC. METTL3 regulates the m6A modification of MEG3 and its expression. This study 
      clarified the role of MEG3/miR-544b/BTG2 axis in HCC and also provided new targets 
      for HCC research.

LID - e0139790
AB  - Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3) encodes a lncRNA which is suggested to function 
      as a tumor suppressor. Previous studies suggested that MEG3 functioned through 
      activation of p53, however, the functional properties of MEG3 remain obscure and 
      their relevance to human diseases is under continuous investigation. Here, we try to 
      illuminate the relationship of MEG3 and p53, and the consequence in hepatoma cells. 
      We find that transfection of expression construct of MEG3 enhances stability and 
      transcriptional activity of p53. Deletion analysis of MEG3 confirms that full length 
      and intact structure of MEG3 are critical for it to activate p53-mediated 
      transactivation. Interestingly, our results demonstrate for the first time that MEG3 
      can interact with p53 DNA binding domain and various p53 target genes are 
      deregulated after overexpression of MEG3 in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, results of 
      qRT-PCR have shown that MEG3 RNA is lost or reduced in the majority of HCC samples 
      compared with adjacent non-tumorous samples. Ectopic expression of MEG3 in hepatoma 
      cells significantly inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis. In conclusion, our 
      data demonstrates that MEG3 functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatoma cells 
      through interacting with p53 protein to activate p53-mediated transcriptional 
      activity and influence the expression of partial p53 target genes.

TI  - Application of Long Noncoding RNAs in Osteosarcoma: Biomarkers and Therapeutic 
      Targets.
PG  - 1407-1419
LID - 10.1159/000479205 [doi]
AB  - Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents. 
      Although improvements in therapeutic strategies were achieved, the outcome remains 
      poor for most patients with metastatic or recurrent osteosarcoma. Therefore, it is 
      imperative to identify novel and effective prognostic biomarker and therapeutic 
      targets for the disease. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a novel class of RNA 
      molecules defined as transcripts >200 nucleotides that lack protein coding 
      potential. Many lncRNAs are deregulated in cancer and are important regulators for 
      malignancies. Nine lncRNAs (91H, BCAR4, FGFR3-AS1, HIF2PUT, HOTTIP, HULC, MALAT-1, 
      TUG1, UCA1) are upregulated and considered oncogenic for osteosarcoma. Loc285194 and 
      MEG3 are two lncRNAs downregulated and as tumor suppressor for the disease. 
      Moreover, the expressions of LINC00161 and ODRUL are associated with 
      chemo-resistance of osteosarcoma. The mechanisms for these lncRNAs in regulating 
      development of osteosarcoma are diverse, e.g. ceRNA, Wnt/β-catenin pathway, etc. The 
      lncRNAs identified may serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for 
      osteosarcoma.

TI  - Differential expression of efferocytosis and phagocytosis associated genes in tumor 
      associated macrophages exposed to African American patient derived prostate cancer 
      microenvironment.
PG  - 22-27

AB  - Macrophages are the first line of defense in the cellular environment in response to 
      any antigenic or foreign invasion. Since cancer cells express antigenic molecules 
      and create a tumor microenvironment quite different from the normal cellular 
      environment, macrophages will attack this cancer cells as foreign Invaders. However, 
      the cancer cells adept their ability to suppress macrophage activity by secreting 
      compounds/proteins through unknown mechanisms and train these macrophages to aid in 
      tumorigenesis. These macrophages are commonly known as tumor associated macrophages 
      (TAM). In this study, our goal was to find out key regulatory molecules involved in 
      this conversion of cancer-fighting macrophages to cancer friendly macrophages. We 
      used African American(AA) patient derived established human prostate cancer cells 
      along with the human derived macrophages followed by Affymetrix cDNA microarray 
      analysis. Microarray analysis of the PCa cell exposed macrophages revealed 
      appreciable decrease in mRNA expression of several genes associated with 
      phagocytosis process. Aberrant expression of several noncoding RNAs that control the 
      expression of such phagocytosis associated molecules were also evident. Increased 
      expression of oncogenic miR such as, miR-148, 615, 515, 130, 139 and markedly 
      decreased expression of tumor suppressive miR's MiR-3130, let7c,101,103, 383 were 
      noted. Further, TARGET SCAN analysis demonstrated these differential expression of 
      non-coding RNA's causing down regulation of phagocytosis promoting genes elf5A, 
      Meg3, Tubb5, Sparcl-1, Uch-1, Bsg(CD147), Ube2v, GULP, Stabilin 1 and Pamr1. There 
      is an increase of RAP1GAP gene that causes concomitant decrease in the expression of 
      tubulin genes that promote cytoskeletal assembly in forming phagosomes. In addition 
      Ingenuity pathway analysis of the gene expression data also showed upregulation of 
      antiphagocytic genes IL-10, CD 16, IL-18 and MMP-9. Some core canonical pathways 
      showing physiology of cellular signaling obtained by data analyzed by the Ingenuity 
      software is confirmed a very complex mechanism still to be deciphered involved in 
      the biology of TAM formation by which the rogue cancer cells tame their enemies, the 
      macrophages and actually make them their helper cells to survive and propagate in 
      the tumor microenvironment and thus prepare for epithelial mesenchymal transition 
      for future metastasis and cancer stem cell formation and progression.

AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated that the expression level of maternally expressed 
      gene 3 (MEG3) was lost in various cancers. Low expression of MEG3 is associated with 
      an increased risk of metastasis and a poor prognosis in cancer patients. This 
      meta-analysis investigated the association between MEG3 levels and distant 
      metastasis (DM), lymph node metastasis (LNM), overall survival (OS), and 
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) of cancer patients. A total of 536 participants from 
      9 articles were finally enrolled. The results showed a significant negative 
      association between MEG3 levels and DM (OR = 2.16, 95% CI = 0.99-4.71, P = 0.05, 
      fixed-effect), and it could also predict poor OS (HR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.15-1.24, P = 
      0.006, fixed-effect) and RFS (HR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.29-0.92, P = 0.02, fixed-effect) 
      in cancer patients. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that MEG3 might 
      serve as a potential novel biomarker for indicating the clinical outcomes in human 
      cancers.

AB  - Eukaryotic lncRNAs are RNA molecules defined to be greater than 200 bp in length 
      that are not translated to a protein and operate through several mechanisms, 
      including participating in chromatin remodeling and methylation, influencing the 
      integrity and stability of proteins and complexes, or acting as a sponge for miRNA 
      inhibition. A number of recent studies have concentrated on the relationship between 
      long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 
      most prevalent histological type of liver tumors, accounting for about 80 % of the 
      cases worldwide. Lack of proper molecular markers for diagnosis of HCC and treatment 
      evaluation is a significant problem. Dysregulated expression of HCC-related lncRNAs 
      such as MEG-3, MALAT1, HULC, HOTAIR, and H19 have been identified and closely 
      related with tumorigenesis, metastasis, prognosis and diagnosis. In this review, we 
      summarized recent highlighted functions and molecular mechanisms of the most 
      extensively studied lncRNAs in the pathophysiology of hepatocellular carcinoma and 
      their potential for serving as probable therapeutic targets.

TI  - The gain and loss of long noncoding RNA associated-competing endogenous RNAs in 
      prostate cancer.
PG  - 57228-57238
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.11128 [doi]
AB  - Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common solid tumors in men. However, the 
      molecular mechanism of PC remains unclear. Numerous studies have demonstrated that 
      long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) can act as microRNA (miRNA) sponge, one type of 
      competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), which offers a novel viewpoint to elucidate the 
      mechanisms of PC. Here, we proposed an integrative systems biology approach to infer 
      the gain and loss of ceRNAs in PC. First, we re-annotated exon microarray data to 
      obtain lncRNA expression profiles of PC. Second, by integrating mRNA and miRNA 
      expression, as well as miRNA targets, we constructed lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA 
      networks in cancer and normal samples. The lncRNAs in these two ceRNA networks 
      tended to have a longer transcript length and cover more exons than the lncRNAs not 
      involved in ceRNA networks. Next, we further extracted the gain and loss ceRNA 
      networks in PC. We found that the gain ceRNAs in PC participated in cell cycle, and 
      the loss ceRNAs in PC were associated with metabolism. We also identified potential 
      prognostic ceRNA pairs such as MALAT1-EGR2 and MEG3-AQP3. Finally, we inferred a 
      novel mechanism of known drugs, such as cisplatin, for the treatment of PC through 
      gain and loss ceRNA networks. The potential drugs such as 
      1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranose (TGGP) could modulate lncRNA-mRNA competing 
      relationships, which may uncover new strategy for treating PC. In summary, we 
      systematically investigated the gain and loss of ceRNAs in PC, which may prove 
      useful for identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutics for PC.

TI  - Long non-coding RNAs are emerging targets of phytochemicals for cancer and other

PG  - 1947-1966
LID - 10.1007/s00018-019-03053-0 [doi]
AB  - The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are the crucial regulators of human chronic 
      diseases. Therefore, approaches such as antisense oligonucleotides, RNAi technology, 
      and small molecule inhibitors have been used for the therapeutic targeting of 
      lncRNAs. During the last decade, phytochemicals and nutraceuticals have been 
      explored for their potential against lncRNAs. The common lncRNAs known to be 
      modulated by phytochemicals include ROR, PVT1, HOTAIR, MALAT1, H19, MEG3, PCAT29, 
      PANDAR, NEAT1, and GAS5. The phytochemicals such as curcumin, resveratrol, 
      sulforaphane, berberine, EGCG, and gambogic acid have been examined against lncRNAs. 
      In some cases, formulation of phytochemicals has also been used. The disease models 
      where phytochemicals have been demonstrated to modulate lncRNAs expression include 
      cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. 
      The regulation of lncRNAs by phytochemicals can affect multi-steps of tumor 
      development. When administered in combination with the conventional drugs, 
      phytochemicals can also produce synergistic effects on lncRNAs leading to the 
      sensitization of cancer cells. Phytochemicals target lncRNAs either directly or 
      indirectly by affecting a wide variety of upstream molecules. However, the potential 
      of phytochemicals against lncRNAs has been demonstrated mostly by preclinical 
      studies in cancer models. How the modulation of lncRNAs by phytochemicals produce 
      therapeutic effects on cancer and other chronic diseases is discussed in this 
      review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The study was done to investigate the effect of LncRNA MEG3 on the 
      immunity and autophagy of non-small cell lung carcinoma through the IDO signaling 
      pathway. METHODS: A total of 78 cases of early NSCLC patients (research group; RG) 
      and 69 cases of health controls (control group; CG) during the same time were 
      included. The contents of LncRNA MEG3 and miR-543 in peripheral blood and tissues 
      and their diagnostic values for NSCLC were detected. The relationship between LncRNA 
      MEG3 and miR-543 and their posttreatment contents and influence on the prognosis of 
      NSCLC patients were tested. The expression of LncRNA MEG3, miR-543, and IDO (IDO1, 
      IDO2, and TDO proteins) in the lung tissue of rats and the immune function in the CG 
      and the RG were detected. The effects of LncRNA MEG3 and miR-543 on the biological 
      behavior of NSCLC cells were determined. The role of LncRNA MEG3, miR-543, and IDO 
      in NSCLC was verified. RESULTS: LncRNA MEG3 was low in peripheral blood and tissues, 
      while miR-543 was high (P < 0.05); both had good diagnostic values for NSCLC 
      (P < 0.05). LncRNA MEG3 had a negative correlation with miR-543 (P < 0.05) and 
      influenced the prognosis of NSCLC patients (P < 0.05). LncRNA MEG3 in the lung 
      tissue of rats using IDO inhibitor was elevated compared with that of lung carcinoma 
      model rats (P < 0.05). The level of miR-543 was declined compared with that of lung 
      carcinoma model rats (P < 0.05). The levels of IDO1, IDO2, and TDO proteins were 
      evidently declined compared with those of lung carcinoma model rats (P < 0.05). 
      Compared with lung carcinoma model rats, CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD4(+)/CD8(+) of IDO 
      inhibitor rats were elevated, while CD8(+) was declined (P < 0.05). Cell 
      proliferation and invasion ability and IDO1, IDO2, TDO, Beclin-1, and LC3-II 
      proteins were declined in the sh-LncRNA MEG3 group (P < 0.05), while those in the 
      mimics-miR-543 group were evidently elevated (P < 0.05). However, the double 
      luciferase activity detection and RIP experiment confirmed that there was targeted 
      regulation among them (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MEG3 has low expression in NSCLC and 
      affects the immunity and autophagy of NSCLC cells via regulating the miR-543/IDO 
      signaling pathway, which is effective for the treatment of NSCLC.

AB  - The PI3K/AKT pathway is an intracellular signaling pathway with an indispensable 
      impact on cell cycle control. This pathway is functionally related with cell 
      proliferation, cell survival, metabolism, and quiescence. The crucial role of this 
      pathway in the development of cancer has offered this pathway as a target of novel 
      anti-cancer treatments. Recent researches have demonstrated the role of microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in controlling the PI3K/AKT pathway. Some 
      miRNAs such as miR-155-5p, miR-328-3p, miR-125b-5p, miR-126, miR-331-3p and miR-16 
      inactivate this pathway, while miR-182, miR-106a, miR-193, miR-214, miR-106b, 
      miR-93, miR-21 and miR-103/107 enhance activity of this pathway. Expression levels 
      of PI3K/AKT-associated miRNAs could be used to envisage the survival of cancer 
      patients. Numerous lncRNAs such as GAS5, FER1L4, LINC00628, PICART1, LOC101928316, 
      ADAMTS9-AS2, SLC25A5-AS1, MEG3, AB073614 and SNHG6 interplay with this pathway. 
      Identification of the impact of miRNAs and lncRNAs in the control of the activity of 
      PI3K/AKT pathway would enhance the efficacy of targeted therapies against this 
      pathway. Moreover, each of the mentioned miRNAs and lncRNAs could be used as a 
      putative therapeutic candidate for the interfering with the carcinogenesis. In the 
      current study, we review the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in controlling the PI3K/AKT 
      pathway and their contribution to carcinogenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of long non-coding ribonucleic acid 
      (lncRNA)-maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) on the Notch signaling pathway, and its 
      influences on the proliferation and apoptosis of osteosarcoma MG-63 cells. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: LncRNA MEG3 was overexpressed in osteosarcoma MG-63 cells, and the 
      cells were divided into Blank group, Len-con group, and Len-MEG3 group. The 
      expression level of MEG3 in each group was detected via quantitative Polymerase 
      Chain Reaction (qPCR), the cell proliferation level in each group was detected via 
      Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and the apoptosis in each group was detected via 
      Hoechst 33258 staining. Moreover, the content of the inflammatory factors in each 
      group was determined using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the 
      expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins and Notch signaling pathway-related 
      proteins were determined through Western blotting. RESULTS: The expression level of 
      lncRNA MEG3 in Len-MEG3 group was significantly higher than that in the Blank group 
      and Len-con group (p<0.01). The overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 could significantly 
      weaken the proliferation (p<0.01) and enhance the apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells 
      (p<0.01). The overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 could significantly increase the content 
      of the inflammatory factor interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 
      (p<0.01), and remarkably decrease the content of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 
      in osteosarcoma cells (p<0.01). Besides, the overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 could 
      evidently raise the expression of Caspase3 (p<0.01) and reduce the Bcl-2/Bax 
      expression in osteosarcoma cells (p<0.01). Finally, the overexpression of lncRNA 
      MEG3 could remarkably reduce the protein expressions of Jagged1, Notch1, and NICD1 
      in osteosarcoma cells (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 can 
      inhibit the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of osteosarcoma MG-63 cells by 
      suppressing the Notch signaling pathway.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms of long noncoding RNAs on gastric cancer.
PG  - 8601-12
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.6926 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein coding transcripts longer than 200 
      nucleotides. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs has been found associated with gastric 
      cancer, one of the most malignant tumors. By complementary base pairing with mRNAs 
      or forming complexes with RNA binding proteins (RBPs), some lncRNAs including GHET1, 
      MALAT1, and TINCR may mediate mRNA stability and splicing. Other lncRNAs, such as 
      BC032469, GAPLINC, and HOTAIR, participate in the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) 
      network. Under certain circumstances, ANRIL, GACAT3, H19, MEG3, and TUSC7 exhibit 
      their biological roles by associating with microRNAs (miRNAs). By recruiting 
      histone-modifying complexes, ANRIL, FENDRR, H19, HOTAIR, MALAT1, and PVT1 may 
      inhibit the transcription of target genes in cis or trans. Through these mechanisms, 
      lncRNAs form RNA-dsDNA triplex. CCAT1, GAPLINC, GAS5, H19, MEG3, and TUSC7 play 
      oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles by correlated with tumor suppressor P53 or 
      onco-protein c-Myc, respectively. In conclusion, interaction with DNA, RNA and 
      proteins is involved in lncRNAs' participation in gastric tumorigenesis and 
      development.

TI  - miRNAs generated from Meg3-Mirg locus are downregulated during aging.
PG  - 15875-15897
LID - 10.18632/aging.203208 [doi]
AB  - Aging determines a multilevel functional decline and increases the risk for 
      cardiovascular pathologies. MicroRNAs are recognized as fine tuners of all cellular 
      functions, being involved in various cardiac diseases. The heart is one of the most 
      affected organs in aged individuals, however little is known about the extent and 
      robustness to which miRNA profiles are modulated in cardiac cells during aging. This 
      paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the aging-associated miRNA 
      profile in the murine cardiac fibroblasts, which are increasingly recognized for 
      their active involvement in the cardiac physiology and pathology. Next-generation 
      sequencing of cardiac fibroblasts isolated from young and old mice revealed that an 
      important fraction of the miRNAs generated by the Meg3-Mirg locus was downregulated 
      during aging. To address the specificity of this repression, four miRNAs selected as 
      representative for this locus were further assessed in other cells and organs 
      isolated from aged mice. The results suggested that the repression of miRNAs 
      generated by the Meg3-Mirg locus was a general feature of aging in multiple organs. 
      Bioinformatic analysis of the predicted target genes identified Integrin Beta-2 as 
      an aged-upregulated gene, which was thereafter confirmed in multiple mouse organs. 
      In conclusion, our study provides new data concerning the mechanisms of natural 
      aging and highlights the robustness of the miRNA modulation during this process.

AB  - The development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex pathological process. 
      Long intergenic non-protein-coding RNA 1667 (LINC01667, also known as MGC38584) 
      plays an oncogenic role in several human cancers; however, its functional role in 
      HCC tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here, we first evaluated the gene expression 
      levels of LINC01667 in HCC using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene 
      Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. We then elucidated the 
      association between LINC01667 gene expression levels and the survival rates of 
      patients with HCC. We detected the effect of LINC01667 on the malignant phenotypes 
      (cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis etc.) and the MAPK and 
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways of HepG2, SMMC-7721 and HUH7 cells. We also 
      analyzed the sensitivity of HepG2, SMMC-7721 and HUH7 with different expression 
      levels of LINC01667 to anti-HCC drugs in vitro. Based on data from the 
      aforementioned databases and our experiments in vitro, we found that LINC01667 was 
      overexpressed in HCC, and that patients with high LINC01667 levels had a remarkably 
      poor overall survival rate. In addition, inhibition of LINC01667 expression 
      suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells 
      and promoted their apoptosis in vitro. In contrast, overexpression of LINC01667 
      promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of HUH7 cells and suppressed 
      their apoptosis in vitro. ChIRP-seq (chromatin isolation by RNA purification) showed 
      that LINC01667 bound to MEG3, and downregulated the expression of MEG3. In addition, 
      western blotting showed that LINC01667 could activate the NF-κB pathway to promote 
      cancer progression. In conclusion, we report that LINC01667 is an important oncogene 
      in HCC and may be used as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of HCC.

TI  - Long non-coding RNA MEG3 impacts diabetic nephropathy progression through sponging 
      miR-145.
PG  - 6691-6698
AB  - Long non-coding RNA MEG3 has been reported to implicate in the progression of 
      several cancers. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the role of MEG3 in the 
      development of diabetic nephropathy. Here, we demonstrated MEG3 was differently 
      expressed by > 4 fold and was elevated significantly using lncRNA microarray in DN 
      patient serum. Besides, MEG3 knockdown alleviated proliferation, fibrosis and 
      induced apoptosis of mesangial cells under high glucose condition. Furthermore, 
      bioinformatics predictions showed that MEG3 is a direct target of miR-145. In the 
      vivo experiment, we found MEG3 silencing decreased the laboratory indicators and 
      fibrosis-related protein secretion in db/db mice. Altogether, our study suggests 
      MEG3 may play as an important role in progression of diabetic nephropathy, 
      contributing to a novel understanding of pathogenesis and underlying therapeutic 
      strategies for diabetic nephropathy.

TI  - Long noncoding RNA MEG3 prevents vascular endothelial cell senescence by impairing 
      miR-128-dependent Girdin downregulation.
PG  - C830-C843
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00262.2018 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are commonly associated with various biological 
      functions, in which the function of lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) has 
      been identified in various cancers. Strikingly, an association between MEG3 with 
      microRNAs (miRNAs), mRNAs, and proteins has been reported. This study investigates 
      the role of MEG3 in vascular endothelial cell (VEC) senescence. Expression of Girdin 
      and miR-128 was monitored in the blood vessel samples of young and old mice/healthy 
      volunteers, along with the measurement of human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
      (HUVECs). The relationship between MEG3/Girdin and miR-128 was determined and 
      verified. Loss- and gain-of-function approaches were applied to analyze the 
      regulatory effects of MEG3 on platelet phagocytosis and lipoprotein oxidation of 
      HUVEC membrane. In addition, the effect of MEG3 on HUVEC senescence was evaluated by 
      detection of the reactive oxygen species, telomerase activity, and telomere length. 
      To further analyze the MEG3-mediated regulatory mechanism, miR-128 upregulation and 
      inhibition were introduced into the HUVECs. Downregulated Girdin and upregulated 
      miR-128 were found in the blood vessels of old individuals and old mice, as well as 
      in senescent HUVECs. MEG3 downregulation was found to be capable of inhibiting 
      Girdin but enhancing miR-128 expression. It was also indicated to inhibit platelet 
      phagocytosis and reduce telomerase activity and telomere length, while enhancing 
      lipoprotein oxidation and reactive oxygen species production, which ultimately 
      contributed in preventing and protecting HUEVCs from senescence. These findings 
      provide evidence supporting that MEG3 leads to miR-128 downregulation and Girdin 
      upregulation, which promotes platelet phagocytosis, thus protecting VECs from 
      senescence.

      urological cancers.

LID - 10.2147/CMAR.S190764 [doi]
AB  - Genomic imprinting has been found to be involved in human physical development and 
      several diseases. The DLK1-DIO3 imprinted domain is located on human chromosome 14 
      and contains paternally expressed protein-coding genes (DLK1, RTL1, DIO3) and 
      numerous maternally expressed ncRNA genes (MEG3, MEG8, antisense RTL1, miRNAs, 
      piRNAs, and snoRNAs). Emerging evidence has implicated that dysregulation of the 
      DLK1-DIO3 imprinted domain especially the imprinted ncRNAs is critical for tumor 
      progressions. Multiple miRNAs and lncRNAs have been investigated in urological 
      cancers, of which several are transcribed from this domain. In this review, we 
      present current data about the associated miRNAs, lncRNAs, and piRNAs and the 
      regulation of differentially methylated regions methylation status in the 
      progression of urological cancers and preliminarily propose certain concepts about 
      the potential regulatory networks involved in DLK1-DIO3 imprinted domain.

TI  - Sperm imprinting integrity in seminoma patients?
PG  - 125

LID - 125
AB  - BACKGROUND: Testicular germ cell tumor such as seminoma is strongly associated with 
      male reproductive problems commonly associated with the alteration of sperm 
      parameters as described in testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Interestingly, numerous 
      studies have reported that the precursor of germ cell cancer, germ cell neoplasia in 
      situ (GCNIS), present similarities to fetal gonocytes, specifically characterized by 
      global DNA hypomethylation particularly on imprinting sequences. These disorders may 
      have a common origin derived from perturbations of embryonal programming during 
      fetal development. Presently, there is no available information concerning the sperm 
      DNA methylation patterns of testicular cancer patients. For the first time, we 
      evaluated the sperm imprinting of seminoma patients. A total of 92 cryopreserved 
      sperm samples were included, 31 before seminoma treatment (S): 23 normozoospermic 
      (SN) and 8 oligozoospermic (SO) and 61 sperm controls samples: 31 normozoospermic 
      (N) and 30 oligozoospermic (O). DNA methylation levels of seven differentially 
      methylated regions (DMRs) of imprinted genes [H19/IGF2: IG-DMR (CTCF3 and CTCF6 of 
      H19 gene); IGF2-DMRs (DMR0 and DMR2); MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR; SNURF:TSS-DMR; 
      KCNQ1OT1:TSS-DMR] were assessed by pyrosequencing. All comparative analyses were 
      adjusted for age. RESULTS: Comparisons of sperm DNA methylation levels between 
      seminoma (S) and normozoospermic (N) samples showed a significant difference for the 
      SNURF sequence (p = 0.017), but after taking into account the sperm parameters, no 
      difference was observed. However, we confirmed a significant association between 
      oligozoospermia (O) and imprinting defects for H19/IGF2-CTCF6 (p = 0.001), MEG3/DLK1 
      (p = 0.017), IGF2-DMR2 (p = 0.022), and SNURF (p = 0.032) in comparison with control 
      groups (N). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the high risk of sperm imprinting 
      defects in cases of oligozoospermia and shows for the first time that seminoma 
      patients with normal spermatogenesis present sperm imprinting integrity. These data 
      suggest a low probability of the involvement of a common imprinting defect in fetal 
      cells leading to both TGCT and subfertility.

AB  - The abnormal expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed 3 
      (MEG3) is closely related to several tumor diagnosis and progression, such as 
      endometrial carcinoma and ovarian cancer. However, the role of MEG3 in oral squamous 
      cell carcinoma (OSCC) is rarely reported. The current study aimed to evaluate the 
      expression of lncRNA MEG3 in OSCC tissues and cell lines and its effect on the 
      biological behavior of OSCC cell lines. The expression of lncRNA MEG3 in the OSCC 
      tissues and cell lines was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q) 
      PCR. The relationship between MEG3 expression and the clinicopathologic 
      characteristics and prognosis of patients with OSCC was analyzed. The lncRNA MEG3 
      overexpression plasmid and control plasmid were transfected into SCC25 and CAL27 
      cell lines using the lipofectin method. MTT assay was performed to detect the growth 
      and proliferation of the cell lines. Transwell chamber test was used to detect 
      changes in cell migration and invasion. Flow cytometry was employed to detect 
      changes in apoptosis. Western blotting and RT-qPCR were conducted to detect the 
      expression of the p53 gene. The expression of lncRNA MEG3 in the OSCC tissues and 
      cell lines was significantly compared with normal tissues and cell lines, 
      respectively. The expression level of MEG3 was related to clinical stage, lymph node 
      metastasis, distant metastasis and survival status. Overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 
      inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of SCC25 and CAL27 cell lines, 
      induced apoptosis and promoted the expression of p53 gene. lncRNA MEG3 played the 
      role of a tumor inhibitor gene and significantly inhibited the biological activity 
      of OSCC cell lines, which may provide a novel idea for molecular targeted therapy of 
      OSCC.

TI  - Long noncoding RNA MEG3 decreases the growth of head and neck squamous cell 
      carcinoma by regulating the expression of miR-421 and E-cadherin.
PG  - 3954-3963

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternally expressed 3 (MEG3), a long chain noncoding RNA (lncRNA), has 
      verified its function as a suppressor in several kinds of cancers. However, the 
      downstream mechanism of MEG3 in regulating the molecular mechanism of 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
      (HNSCC) progression demands further investigation. METHODS: Quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the expression level of 
      MEG3 in HNSCC and adjacent normal tissues of 51 cases. Luciferase report assay was 
      used to detect the correlation between miR-421 and MEG3, and miR-421 and E-cadherin 
      in HNSCC cell lines. Cell invasion and proliferation capacity were assessed through 
      transwell and CCK8 assays. Scratch wound assay was used to assess cell migration 
      capacity. RESULTS: Firstly, this study demonstrated that the expression of MEG3 was 
      significantly downregulated in HNSCC compared to adjacent normal tissues. 
      Overexpressed MEG3 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. 
      Secondly, MEG3 upregulated the expression of E-cadherin, which was instead 
      downregulated by miR-421. MiR-421 was negatively regulated by MEG3 in HNSCC. 
      Therefore, MEG3 regulated EMT by sponging miR-421 targeting E-cadherin in HNSCC. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the MEG3-miR-421-E-cadherin axis could be a 
      new therapeutic target for HNSCC.

TI  - Long non‑coding RNA MEG3 suppresses the growth of glioma cells by regulating the 
      miR‑96‑5p/MTSS1 signaling pathway.
PG  - 4215-4225
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2019.10659 [doi]
AB  - Glioma is one of the most common types of tumor of the central nervous system with 
      high mobility and mortality. The prognosis of patients with high‑grade glioma is 
      poor. Therefore, it is urgent to develop the therapeutic strategies for the 
      treatment of glioma. Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported as potential 
      inducers or suppressors of numerous types of tumors including glioma. Previous 
      studies have revealed that lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is involved in 
      the initiation and progression of cancer; however, the underlying mechanisms remain 
      unclear. In the present study, MEG3 was downregulated in glioma tissue. In addition, 
      downregulation of MEG3 was observed in human glioma cell lines compared with normal 
      astrocyte cells. Furthermore, overexpressed MEG3 inhibited the proliferation, 
      migration and invasion of glioma cells. Additionally, microRNA‑96‑5p (miR‑96‑5p) was 
      a promising target of MEG3, and the promoting effects of miR‑96‑5p on cell growth 
      and metastasis could be reversed by upregulated MEG3. Metastasis suppressor 1 
      (MTSS1) was predicted as the putative target of miR‑96‑5p, and its expression was 
      restored by MEG3. In summary, the present data provided novel insight into the roles 
      of MEG3 in glioma, and MEG3/miR‑96‑5p/MTSS1 signaling could be a promising 
      therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with glioma.

LID - 10.3390/cancers7030843 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) represent a novel class of RNAs with no functional 
      protein-coding ability, yet it has become increasingly clear that interactions 
      between lncRNAs with other molecules are responsible for important gene regulatory 
      functions in various contexts. Given their relatively high expressions in the brain, 
      lncRNAs are now thought to play important roles in normal brain development as well 
      as diverse disease processes including gliomagenesis. Intriguingly, certain lncRNAs 
      are closely associated with the initiation, differentiation, progression, recurrence 
      and stem-like characteristics in glioma, and may therefore be exploited for the 
      purposes of sub-classification, diagnosis and prognosis. LncRNAs may also serve as 
      potential therapeutic targets as well as a novel biomarkers in the treatment of 
      glioma. In this article, the functional aspects of lncRNAs, particularly within the 
      central nervous system (CNS), will be briefly discussed, followed by highlights of 
      the important roles of lncRNAs in mediating critical steps during glioma 
      development. In addition, the key lncRNA players and their possible mechanistic 
      pathways associated with gliomagenesis will be addressed.

AB  - The abnormal expression of long noncoding RNA- (lncRNA-) MEG3 was clearly identified 
      in a number of malignant tumors, but the specific function of MEG3 remains unknown 
      in malignant melanoma until now. The research attempts to explore the effects of 
      MEG3 on the growth and metastasis of malignant melanoma. MEG3 and miR-499-5p 
      expression were determined by qRT-PCR method. Western blotting assay was applied to 
      detect protein expression. Luciferase reporter assay was used to assess the 
      correlation between MEG3 and miR-499-5p and between CYLD and miR-499-5p. Cell 
      growth, cell cycle, and cell apoptosis were examined by CCK-8 assay, EdU assay, and 
      flow cytometry assay, respectively. The invasion ability of melanoma cells was 
      investigated by wound-healing and Transwell assays. The effect of MEG3 on growth of 
      melanoma in vivo and cell chemosensitivity was detected by xenograft animal model 
      and CCK-8 assay. As a result, the expression of MEG3 was decreased in melanoma 
      tissues and cell lines. The level of MEG3 was significantly associated with poor 
      prognosis. MEG3 could bind to miR-499-5p and CYLD mRNA contained a binding site of 
      miR-499-5p. The expression of CYLD was reduced and the level of miR-499-5p was 
      elevated in melanoma tissues and cell lines. Luciferase reporter assay and western 
      blot assay confirmed that MEG3 regulated the expression of CYLD by sponging 
      miR-499-5p. Functionally, upregulation of MEG3 inhibited melanoma cell 
      proliferation, invasion, and migration, enhanced melanoma cell apoptosis, arrested 
      melanoma cell cycle, and regulated the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and 
      cyclin D1 by regulating CYLD expression mediated by sponging miR-499-5p. 
      Importantly, overexpression of MEG3 suppressed the growth of xenograft tumor and 
      improved chemotherapy sensitivity of A375 cells to cisplatin and 5-FU treatment. In 
      conclusion, MEG3 has a crucial function in the tumorigenesis of melanoma, and MEG3 
      may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of melanoma.

TI  - Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs and the Molecular Mechanisms Involved in Insulin 
      Resistance.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22147256 [doi]
LID - 7256
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are single-stranded RNA biomolecules with a length of 
      >200 nt, and they are currently considered to be master regulators of many 
      pathological processes. Recent publications have shown that lncRNAs play important 
      roles in the pathogenesis and progression of insulin resistance (IR) and glucose 
      homeostasis by regulating inflammatory and lipogenic processes. lncRNAs regulate 
      gene expression by binding to other non-coding RNAs, mRNAs, proteins, and DNA. In 
      recent years, several mechanisms have been reported to explain the key roles of 
      lncRNAs in the development of IR, including metastasis-associated lung 
      adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), imprinted maternal-ly expressed transcript 
      (H19), maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), myocardial infarction-associated 
      transcript (MIAT), and steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA), HOX transcript 
      antisense RNA (HOTAIR), and downregulated Expression-Related Hexose/Glucose 
      Transport Enhancer (DREH). LncRNAs participate in the regulation of lipid and 
      carbohydrate metabolism, the inflammatory process, and oxidative stress through 
      different pathways, such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A 
      (cAMP/PKA), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), 
      polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1/element-binding transcription factor 1c 
      (PTBP1/SREBP-1c), AKT/nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), AKT/forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), and 
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)/c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK). On the other 
      hand, the mechanisms linked to the molecular, cellular, and biochemical actions of 
      lncRNAs vary according to the tissue, biological species, and the severity of IR. 
      Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the role of lncRNAs in the insulin signaling 
      pathway and glucose and lipid metabolism. This review analyzes the function and 
      molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs involved in the development of IR.

TI  - LncRNA HLA-F-AS1 Enhances the Migration, Invasion and Apoptosis of Glioblastoma 
      Cells by Targeting lncRNA MEG3.
PG  - 9139-9145
LID - 10.2147/CMAR.S322351 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies revealed the oncogenic role of long non-coding RNA 
      (lncRNA) HLA-F-AS1 in colon cancer and breast cancer, while its role in other 
      cancers is unclear. We predicted the direct interaction between HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3, 
      which is a tumor suppressor lncRNA. We then assessed the interaction between 
      HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3 in glioblastoma (GBM). METHODS: The expression levels of 
      HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3 in GBM and paired non-tumor tissues from 60 GBM patients were 
      analyzed by RT-qPCR. Overexpression of HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3 was achieved in GBM cells 
      to explore the interaction between them. The direct interaction between them was 
      confirmed by RNA pull-down assay. The roles of HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3 in cell invasion, 
      migration and apoptosis were explored by Transwell assays and cell apoptosis assay. 
      RESULTS: HLA-F-AS1 was highly expressed, and MEG3 was downregulated in GBM. 
      Overexpression of HLA-F-AS1 reduced the expression levels of MEG3 while 
      overexpression of MEG3 did not alter the expression of HLA-F-AS1. HLA-F-AS1 
      increased cell migration and invasion, but decreased cell apoptosis. MEG3 played 
      opposite roles and reduced the effects of HLA-F-AS1 on cell behaviors. CONCLUSION: 
      HLA-F-AS1 may sponge MEG3 in GBM cells to promote cell invasion and migration, and 
      to suppress cell apoptosis.

TI  - MEG3 is a prognostic factor for CRC and promotes chemosensitivity by enhancing 
      oxaliplatin-induced cell apoptosis.
PG  - 1383-1392
LID - 10.3892/or.2017.5828 [doi]
AB  - A major reason for the failure of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment is the 
      occurrence of chemoresistance to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Recently, studies 
      have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in drug 
      resistance. Using HiSeq sequencing methods, we identified that lncRNAs show 
      differential expression levels in oxaliplatin-resistant (OxR) and non-resistant CRC 
      patients. RT-qPCR was then performed in tissues and serum samples, and lncRNA MEG3 
      was verified to be downregulated in non-responding patients and to have considerable 
      discriminating potential to identify responding patients from non-responding 
      patients. Moreover, decreased serum MEG3 expression was associated with poor 
      chemoresponse and low survival rate in CRC patients receiving oxaliplatin treatment. 
      Subsequently, OxR cell lines were established, and MEG3 was significantly 
      downregulated in HT29 OxR and SW480 OxR cells. In addition, overexpression of MEG3 
      with pMEG3 reversed oxaliplatin resistance in both CRC cell lines. Flow cytometric 
      apoptosis analysis indicated that MEG3 promoted CRC cell apoptosis. More 
      importantly, MEG3 enhanced oxaliplatin‑induced cell cytotoxicity in CRC. In 
      conclusion, our integrated approach demonstrated that decreased expression of lncRNA 
      MEG3 in CRC confers potent poor therapeutic efficacy, and that MEG3 promotes 
      chemosensitivity by enhancing oxaliplatin-induced cell apoptosis. Thus, 
      overexpression of MEG3 may be a future direction by which to develop a novel 
      therapeutic strategy to overcome oxaliplatin resistance of CRC patients.

AB  - Gastric carcinoma is one of the most frequently diagnosed gastrointestinal tumors. 
      Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are broadly defined as endogenous cellular non‑coding 
      RNA molecules. Studies have demonstrated that they may be associated with human 
      cancer progression. In the present study, the role of lncRNA‑maternally expressed 
      gene 3 (MEG3) in the progression of gastric carcinoma cells was investigated 
      in vitro and in vivo. It was demonstrated that lncRNA‑MEG3 expression was 
      downregulated in gastric carcinoma cells compared with normal gastric cells. 
      lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection increased E‑cadherin expression and markedly inhibited 
      gastric carcinoma cell growth, migration and invasion. Flow cytometric analysis 
      revealed that lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection promoted the apoptosis of gastric carcinoma 
      cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection inhibited 
      the expression of anti‑apoptotic proteins B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl‑2) and Bcl‑2‑like 
      protein 2 and increased the expression of pro‑-apoptotic proteins caspase‑3 and 
      caspase‑9 in gastric carcinoma cells. lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection upregulated the 
      expression of epithelial marker E‑cadherin and inhibited the expression of 
      mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin in gastric carcinoma cells, which 
      suggested that lncRNA‑MEG3 inhibited epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), which 
      may subsequently inhibit progression in gastric carcinoma cells. The present study 
      also revealed that lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection suppressed tumor growth mainly by 
      decreasing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and increasing the 
      expression of Bcl‑2 in vivo. In conclusion, these results indicated that lncRNA‑MEG3 
      may regulate EMT‑associated signaling pathways and has the potential as a 
      therapeutic target in gastric carcinoma.

AB  - Cardiac hypertrophy is closely correlated with diverse cardiovascular diseases, 
      augmenting the risk of heart failure and sudden death. Long non-coding RNAs 
      (lncRNAs) have been studied in cardiac hypertrophy for their regulatory function. 
      LncRNA MEG3 has been reported in human cancers. Whereas, it is unknown whether MEG3 
      regulates the growth of cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, this study aims to 
      investigate the specific role of MEG3 in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. 
      Here, we found that MEG3 contributed to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. 
      MEG3 expression was remarkably strengthened in the mice heart which undergone the 
      transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that MEG3 
      was upregulated in the cardiomyocytes which were treated with Ang-II. Silenced MEG3 
      inhibited the increasing size of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes and reversed other 
      hypertrophic responses. Mechanically, MEG3 could affect cardiac hypertrophy by 
      regulating gene expression. Mechanically, we found that MEG3 could be upregulated by 
      the transcription factor STAT3 and could regulate miR-361-5p and HDAC9 by acting as 
      a ceRNA. Finally, rescue assays were made to do further confirmation. All our 
      findings revealed that STAT3-inducetd upregulation of lncRNA MEG3 controls cardiac 
      hypertrophy by regulating miR-362-5p/HDAC9 axis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore whether maternally expressed gene 3 
      (MEG3) could facilitate the proliferation and migration of oral squamous cell 
      carcinoma (OSCC) cells by selectively binding to miR-21, thereby participating in 
      the progression of OSCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression levels of MEG3 and 
      miR-21 in OSCC tissues and normal control tissues were detected by quantitative Real 
      Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The effects of MEG3 and miR-21 on cell 
      proliferation and migration were examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell, 
      and scratch assay, respectively. Meanwhile, cell cycle was detected using flow 
      cytometry. The binding relationship between miR-21 and MEG3 was confirmed by dual 
      luciferase assay. In addition, MEG3 and miR-21 were simultaneously knock-down to 
      figure out whether MEG3 could regulate the proliferation and migration of OSCC cells 
      through targeted binding to miR-21. RESULTS: QRT-PCR results indicated that MEG3 
      expression in OSCC tissues was remarkably lower than that of normal control tissues. 
      However, the expression of miR-21 was significantly higher in OSCC tissues. 
      Meanwhile, it was found that inhibiting MEG3 expression in OSCC cell lines could 
      significantly promote cell proliferation and migration, while the simultaneous 
      inhibition of miR-21 showed the opposite effect. Dual Luciferase assay results 
      revealed that MEG3 could selectively bind to miR-21. In addition, we demonstrated 
      that the knockdown of MEG3 in Tca-8113 and CAL-27 cells partially reversed the 
      inhibitory effect of downregulated-miR-21 on cell proliferation and migration. These 
      results further suggested that MEG3 might regulate OSCC cell proliferation via 
      selectively binding to miR-21. CONCLUSIONS: Low expression of MEG3 can promote the 
      proliferation and migration of OSCC cells through targeted binding to miR-21.

      Pterostilbene in Human Breast Cancer.
PG  - 629
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2018.00629 [doi]
LID - 629
AB  - Background: There is increasing evidence that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are 
      involved in the process of carcinogenesis and treatment using chemotherapy. 
      Pterostilbene, a phytochemical agent with natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
      properties, has been shown to modulate oncogenic processes in many cancers. However, 
      there has been limited research on the association between pterostilbene and the 
      expression of lncRNAs. Methods: MCF7 breast cancer cells were treated with various 
      concentrations of pterostilbene and their gene expression profile was analyzed by 
      quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Results: 
      Treatment with pterostilbene inhibited cell proliferation and 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and increased cell apoptosis, autophagy 
      and ER stress. The Akt/mTOR pathway was downregulated, but p38 MAPK/Erk signaling 
      was activated in cells following treatment with pterostilbene. Pterostilbene 
      increased the expression of the lncRNAs MEG3, TUG1, H19, and DICER1-AS1 whereas the 
      expression of LINC01121, PTTG3P, and HOTAIR declined. Knockdown of lncRNA H19 
      resulted in a reduction of the cell invasion, with the cells becoming more sensitive 
      to pterostilbene therapy. Conclusions: These results suggest that efficient optimum 
      disruption of lncRNA expression might possibly improve the anti-tumor effects of 
      phytochemical agents, thus serving as a potential therapy for breast cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of long non-coding 
      RNA MEG3 (MEG3) and microRNA-361-5p (miR-361-5p) on cholangiocarcinoma cells and to 
      explore the molecular mechanisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The level of MEG3 and 
      miR-361-5p was detected using quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction 
      (qRT-PCR). The relationship between miR-361-5p and MEG3/TNF receptor-associated 
      factor 3 (TRAF3) was confirmed by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay. 
      3-(4,5)-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow 
      cytometry analysis were used to determine cell viability and cell apoptosis. 
      Moreover, the protein level of TRAF3, p65, and p-p65 was measured by Western blot 
      assay. RESULTS: We found that MEG3 was downregulated in CCA tissues and cell lines, 
      especially in TFK1 and QBC939 cells. MEG3 directly bind to miR-361-5p, which was 
      highly expressed in CCA tissues and cell lines. Further analysis indicated that 
      MEG3-plasmid could inhibit cell viability and induce cell apoptosis in CCA cells, 
      but these effects were significantly reversed by miR-361-5p mimic. Moreover, we 
      proved that TRAF3 was a direct target of miR-361-5p and it was downregulated in CCA 
      tissues and cell lines. In addition, we found that miR-361-5p downregulation 
      significantly inhibited CCA cell viability and induced cell apoptosis, and these 
      effects were eliminated by the knockdown of TRAF3. Further functional analysis 
      showed that the knockdown of TRAF3 upregulated the expression of p-p65 decreased by 
      miR-361-5p inhibitor in CCA cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that MEG3 
      repressed cholangiocarcinoma by downregulating miR-361-5p expression. Meanwhile, the 
      suppression of miR-361-5p might improve CCA survival by targeting TRAF3 and 
      inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, which might help to develop new strategies for CCA 
      therapy.

TI  - Long non-coding RNA MEG3 promotes autophagy and apoptosis of nasopharyngeal 
      carcinoma cells via PTEN up-regulation by binding to microRNA-21.
PG  - 61-72
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.15759 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been highlighted as attractive markers for 
      diagnosis and prognosis as well as new therapeutic targets in multiple cancers, 
      including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we attempted to investigate the 
      underlying regulatory role of the lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in NPC 
      development. As determined by RT-qPCR, MEG3 expression was down-regulated in NPC 
      cells. Online RNA crosstalk analysis predicted the binding of miR-21 to MEG3 and 
      PTEN, respectively. MEG3 was validated to bind to miR-21 while PTEN was identified 
      as a target of miR-21 by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Exogenous transfection 
      was done to change the levels of MEG3, miR-21 and PTEN in HK-1 cells to investigate 
      their effects on the autophagy and apoptosis of NPC cells. The results suggested 
      that MEG3 overexpression in HK-1 cells up-regulated PTEN and down-regulated miR-21, 
      by which MEG3 further inhibited autophagy and apoptosis ability of NPC cells. The 
      tumour formation ability was tested after injecting the HK-1 cells into nude, mice 
      and tumour growth was monitored. Consistently, MEG3 overexpression inhibited the 
      tumour formation in vivo. Collectively, MEG3 promotes the autophagy and apoptosis of 
      NPC cells via enhancing PTEN expression by binding to miR-21.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) play an important role in the carcinogenesis of 
      various tumours, including gastric cancer. This study aimed to assess the 
      associations of lncRNA ANRIL, H19, MALAT1, MEG3, HOTAIR single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) with gastric cancer and atrophic gastritis. SNPs were analyzed 
      in 613 gastric cancer patients, 118 patients with atrophic gastritis and 476 
      controls from three tertiary centers in Germany, Lithuania and Latvia. Genomic DNA 
      was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. SNPs were genotyped by the real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction. Results showed that carriers of MALAT1 rs3200401 CT 
      genotype had the significantly higher odds of atrophic gastritis than those with CC 
      genotype (OR-1.81; 95% CI 1.17-2.80, p = 0.0066). Higher odds of AG were found in a 
      recessive model (CC vs. TT + CT) for ANRIL rs1333045 (OR-1.88; 95% CI 1.19-2.95, p = 
      0.0066). Carriers of ANRIL (rs17694493) GG genotype had higher odds of gastric 
      cancer (OR-4.93; 95% CI 1.28-19.00) and atrophic gastritis (OR-5.11; 95% CI 
      1.10-23.80) compared with the CC genotype, and carriers of HOTAIR rs17840857 TG 
      genotype had higher odds of atrophic gastritis (OR-1.61 95% CI 1.04-2.50) compared 
      with the TT genotype; however, the ORs did not reach the adjusted significance 
      threshold (p < 0.007). In summary, our data provide novel evidence for a possible 
      link between lncRNA SNPs and premalignant condition of gastric cancer, suggesting 
      the involvement of lncRNAs in gastric cancer development.

TI  - Radiation-Induced Long Noncoding RNAs in a Mouse Model after Whole-Body Irradiation.
PG  - 251-263
LID - 10.1667/RR14891.1 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key molecules in regulating many 
      biological processes and have been implicated in development and disease 
      pathogenesis. Biomarkers of cancer and normal tissue response to treatment are of 
      great interest in precision medicine, as well as in public health and medical 
      management, such as for assessment of radiation injury after an accidental or 
      intentional exposure. Circulating and functional RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) 
      and lncRNAs, in whole blood and other body fluids are potential valuable candidates 
      as biomarkers. Early prediction of possible acute, intermediate and delayed effects 
      of radiation exposure enables timely therapeutic interventions. To address whether 
      long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) could serve as biomarkers for radiation biodosimetry 
      we performed whole genome transcriptome analysis in a mouse model after whole-body 
      irradiation. Differential lncRNA expression patterns were evaluated at 16, 24 and 48 
      h postirradiation in total RNA isolated from whole blood of mice exposed to 1, 2, 4, 
      8 and 12 Gy of X rays. Sham-irradiated animals served as controls. Significant 
      alterations in the expression patterns of lncRNAs were observed after different 
      radiation doses at the various time points. We identified several radiation-induced 
      lncRNAs known for DNA damage response as well as immune response. Long noncoding RNA 
      targets of tumor protein 53 (P53), Trp53cor1, Dino, Pvt1 and Tug1 and an upstream 
      regulator of p53, Meg3, were altered in response to radiation. Gm14005 ( Morrbid) 
      and Tmevpg1 were regulated by radiation across all time points and doses. These two 
      lncRNAs have important potential as blood-based radiation biomarkers; Gm14005 ( 
      Morrbid) has recently been shown to play a key role in inflammatory response, while 
      Tmevpg1 has been implicated in the regulation of interferon gamma. Precise molecular 
      biomarkers, likely involving a diverse group of inducible molecules, will not only 
      enable the development and effective use of medical countermeasures but may also be 
      used to detect and circumvent or mitigate normal tissue injury in cancer 
      radiotherapy.

TI  - MEG3-4 is a miRNA decoy that regulates IL-1β abundance to initiate and then limit 
      inflammation to prevent sepsis during lung infection.
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao2387 [doi]
LID - eaao2387
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression. We investigated the role of 
      lncRNAs in the inflammatory response to bacterial infection in the lungs. We 
      identified the lncRNA MEG3 as a tissue-specific modulator of inflammatory responses 
      during bacterial infection. Among the 10 transcript isoforms of MEG3, transcript 4 
      (referred to as MEG3-4) encodes the isoform with the lowest abundance in mouse 
      lungs. Nonetheless, we found that MEG3-4 bound to the microRNA miR-138 in a 
      competitive manner with mRNA encoding the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β 
      (IL-1β), thereby increasing IL-1β abundance and intensifying inflammatory responses 
      to bacterial infection in alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells in culture 
      and in lung tissue in mice. MEG3-4-mediated sponging of miR-138 in the cytoplasm 
      increased the autocrine activity of IL-1β that subsequently induced a negative 
      feedback mechanism mediated by nuclear factor κB that decreased MEG3-4 abundance and 
      inflammatory cytokine production. This timely reduction in MEG3-4 abundance tempered 
      proinflammatory responses in mice with pulmonary bacterial infection, preventing the 
      progression to sepsis. Together, these findings reveal that MEG3-4 dynamically 
      modulates pulmonary inflammatory responses through transcriptional regulation of 
      immune response genes, extending the decoy and sponge mechanism associated with 
      lncRNAs to antibacterial immunity, which affects both response and disease 
      progression.

TI  - Down regulation of lncRNA MEG3 promotes colorectal adenocarcinoma cell proliferation 
      and inhibits the apoptosis by up-regulating TGF-β1 and its downstream sphingosine 
      kinase 1.
PG  - 8265-8272

AB  - OBJECTIVE: LncRNA MEG3 is involved in the pathogenesis of several types of cancers. 
      While its participation and function network in colorectal (CR) adenocarcinoma, 
      which is one of the most common malignancies, still hasn't been well studied. 
      Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the role of MEG3 in colorectal 
      adenocarcinoma and to explore the possibly related mechanisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Tumor tissues and adjacent healthy tissues were collected from colorectal 
      adenocarcinoma patients. Blood samples were collected from both colorectal 
      adenocarcinoma patients and healthy controls to prepare serum sample. Expression of 
      MEG3 in those tissues was detected by qRT-PCR. MEG3 knockdown and sphingosine kinase 
      1 (SPHK1) overexpression colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines were established. Its 
      effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis were investigated by CCK-8 assay and MTT 
      assay, respectively. Effects of MEG3 overexpression on TGF-β1 and SPHK1 were 
      investigated by Western blot. RESULTS: MEG3 expression level was decreased in tumor 
      tissues than that in adjacent healthy tissues. Serum level of MEG3 was lower in 
      cancer patients than that in healthy controls, and the serum level decreased with 
      the increased stage of primary tumor. Serum TGF-β1 can be used to predict colorectal 
      adenocarcinoma and its prognosis accurately. MEG3 knockdown and SPHK1 overexpression 
      promoted tumor cell proliferation, but inhibited cell apoptosis. MEG3 knockdown also 
      increased the expression level of TGF-β1 and SPHK1. Treatment with TGF-β1 inhibitor 
      reduced the expression level of SPHK1 but showed no significant effects on MEG3. 
      SPHK1 overexpression showed no significant effects on MEG3 and TGF-β1 expression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of lncRNA MEG3 can promote colorectal adenocarcinoma 
      cell proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis by up-regulating TGF-β1 and its 
      downstream sphingosine kinase 1.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether DNMT1 protein induces retinoblastoma proliferation 
      by silencing MEG3 gene. METHODS: Two retinoblastoma cell lines (HXO-RB44 and 
      SO-RB50) and a normal human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line were 
      transfected with the plasmid pcDNA-DNMT1 or si-DNMT1 for up-regulating or 
      interference of DNMT1 expression, and with pcDNA-MEG3 or si-MEG3 for up-regulating 
      or interference of MEG3 expression. Western blotting was used to detect the changes 
      in the expression of DNMT1 protein in the transfected cells, and CCK-8 and EdU 
      assays were used to detect the changes in cell proliferation. Real-time quantitative 
      PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect MEG3 expression in SO-RB50 and HXO-RB44 cells 
      after transfection, and the methylation level of MEG3 gene promoter after 
      interference of DNMT1 expression was detected using methylation-specific PCR. 
      RESULTS: SO-RB50 and HXO-RB44 cells showed significantly increased expression of 
      DNMT1 protein as compared with normal RPE cells (P < 0.05). In HXO-RB44 cells, 
      transfection with pcDNADNMT1 resulted in significantly increased expression of DNMT1 
      protein, enhanced cell proliferation ability, and significantly reduced expression 
      of MEG3 (P < 0.05). In SO-RB50 cells, transfection with si-DNMT1 significantly 
      reduced the expression of DNMT1 protein, suppressed the cell proliferation, and 
      increased MEG3 expression (P < 0.05). Interference of DNMT1 significantly reduced 
      the methylation level of MEG3 gene promoter. After reversing the regulatory effect 
      of DNMT1 on MEG3 gene, DNMT1 protein showed significantly weakened ability to 
      regulate retinoblastoma cell proliferation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      retinoblastoma cells, the up-regulation of DNMT1 protein induces promoter 
      methylation and inactivation of MEG3 gene and eventually leads to abnormal cell 
      proliferation.

AB  - Fully elucidating the molecular mechanisms of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including 
      micro RNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), underlying 
      hepatocarcinogenesis is challenging. We characterized the expression profiles of 
      ncRNAs and constructed a regulatory mRNA-lncRNA-miRNA (MLMI) network based on 
      transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 9) 
      patients. Of the identified miRNAs (n = 203) and lncRNAs (n = 1,090), we found 16 
      significantly differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs and three DE lncRNAs. The DE RNAs 
      were highly enriched in 21 functional pathways implicated in HCC (p < 0.05), 
      including p53, MAPK, and NAFLD signaling. Potential pairwise interactions between DE 
      ncRNAs and mRNAs were fully characterized using in silico prediction and 
      experimentally-validated evidence. We for the first time constructed a MLMI network 
      of reciprocal interactions for 16 miRNAs, three lncRNAs, and 253 mRNAs in HCC. The 
      predominant role of MEG3 in the MLMI network was validated by its overexpression in 
      vitro that the expression levels of a proportion of MEG3-targeted miRNAs and mRNAs 
      was changed significantly. Our results suggested that the comprehensive MLMI network 
      synergistically modulated carcinogenesis, and the crosstalk of the network provides 
      a new avenue to accurately describe the molecular mechanisms of 
      hepatocarcinogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dysregulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is associated with 
      the proliferation and metastasis in a variety of cancers, of which lncRNA maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (MEG3) has been indicated as a tumor suppressor in multiple 
      malignancies. However, the underlying mechanisms by which MEG3 contributes to human 
      hemangiomas (HAs) remain undetermined. METHODS: qRT-PCR analysis was performed to 
      examine the expression levels of MEG3 and VEGF in proliferating or involuting phase 
      HAs. MTT, colony formation assay, flow cytometry analysis and a subcutaneous 
      xenograft tumor model were conducted to assess the effects of MEG3 on the HAs 
      tumorigenesis. The interaction between MEG3 and miRNAs or their downstream pathways 
      was evidenced by bioinformatic analysis, luciferase report assays, RNA 
      immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The expression 
      of MEG3 was substantially decreased and had a negative correlation with VEGF 
      expression in proliferating phase HAs, as compared with the involuting phase HAs and 
      normal skin tissues. Ectopic expression of MEG3 suppressed cell proliferation, 
      colony formation and induced cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo, followed by the 
      downregulation of VEGF and cyclinD1, but knockdown of MEG3 reversed these effects. 
      Furthermore, MEG3 was verified to act as a sponge of miR-494 in HAs cells, and 
      miR-494 counteracted MEG3-caused anti-proliferative effects by regulating 
      PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, and exhibited the negative correlation with MEG3 and PTEN 
      expression in proliferating phase HAs. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that 
      lncRNA MEG3 inhibited HAs tumorigenesis by sponging miR-494 and regulating 
      PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway.

      biomarker in progression and poor prognosis of osteosarcoma.
PG  - 15138-42
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Long non-coding RNA MEG3 (lncRNA MEG3) has been showed to involve in a 
      variety of cancers. However, the association between lncRNA MEG3 expression level 
      and the prognosis of osteosarcoma is still unclear. METHODS: The expression levels 
      of lncRNA MEG3 in osteosarcoma tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues were detected 
      using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Differences in patient survival were 
      determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test. A Cox proportional 
      hazards regression analysis was used for univariate and multivariate analyses of 
      prognostic values. RESULTS: Our findings showed that expression of lncRNA MEG3 was 
      clearly lower in osteosarcoma tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. The 
      expression of lncRNA MEG3 was associated with clinical stage and distant metastasis 
      (P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with low lncRNA MEG3 expression 
      had a shorter overall survival (log-rank test, P<0.05). Furthermore, multivariate 
      analysis revealed that decreased expression of lncRNA MEG3, advanced clinical stage 
      and distant metastasis were all independent predictors to overall survival of 
      osteosarcoma patients. CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of lncRNA MEG3 was associated 
      with poor overall survival of osteosarcoma. LncRNA MEG3 could be a useful biomarker 
      for progression and prognosis of osteosarcoma.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as oncogenes or tumor suppressors 
      that are involved in tumorigenesis and chemotherapy drug resistance. Maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is an imprinted gene located at 14q32 that encodes an 
      lncRNA, and decreased MEG3 expression plays an important role in multiple cancers. 
      However, its biological role in the development of the chemoresistance phenotype of 
      human lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) is unknown. This study aimed to observe the 
      expression of MEG3 in LAD and to evaluate its biological role and clinical 
      significance in the resistance of LAD cells to cisplatin. MEG3 expression was 
      markedly decreased in cisplatin-resistant A549/DDP cells compared with parental A549 
      cells as shown by an lncRNA microarray. MEG3 overexpression in A549/DDP cells 
      increased their chemosensitivity to cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo by 
      inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. By contrast, MEG3 knockdown in 
      A549 cells decreased the chemosensitivity. Moreover, MEG3 was decreased in 
      cisplatin-insensitive LAD tissues while p53 protein levels were decreased and Bcl-xl 
      protein levels increased. Furthermore, patients with lower levels of MEG3 expression 
      showed worse responses to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. These findings demonstrate 
      that MEG3 is significantly downregulated in LAD and partially regulates the 
      cisplatin resistance of LAD cells through the control of p53 and Bcl-xl expression. 
      Thus, MEG3 may represent a new marker of poor response to cisplatin and could be a 
      potential therapeutic target for LAD chemotherapy.

TI  - Maternal blood lead concentrations, DNA methylation of MEG3 DMR regulating the

AB  - Prenatal exposure to lead (Pb) is known to decrease fetal growth; but its effects on 
      postnatal growth and mechanistic insights linking Pb to growth are not clearly 
      defined. Genomically imprinted genes are powerful regulators of growth and energy 
      utilization, and may be particularly vulnerable to environmental Pb exposure. 
      Because imprinting is established early and maintained via DNA methylation, we 
      hypothesized that prenatal Pb exposure alters DNA methylation of imprinted genes 
      resulting in lower birth weight and rapid growth. Pb was measured by inductively 
      coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in peripheral blood of 321 women of the 
      Newborn Epigenetic STudy (NEST) obtained at gestation ~12 weeks. Linear and logistic 
      regression models were used to evaluate associations between maternal Pb levels, 
      methylation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) regulating H19, MEG3, PEG3, 
      and PLAGL1, measured by pyrosequencing, birth weight, and weight-for-height z score 
      gains between birth and age 1yr, ages 1-2yrs, and 2-3yrs. Children born to women 
      with Pb levels in the upper tertile had higher methylation of the regulatory region 
      of the MEG3 DMR imprinted domain (β= 1.57, se= 0.82, p= 0.06). Pb levels were also 
      associated with lower birth weight (β= -0.41, se= 0.15, p= 0.01) and rapid gains in 
      adiposity (OR= 12.32, 95%CI=1.25-121.30, p= 0.03) by age 2-3 years. These data 
      provide early human evidence for Pb associations with hypermethylation at the MEG3 
      DMR regulatory region and rapid adiposity gain-a risk factor for childhood obesity 
      and cardiometabolic diseases in adulthood.

AB  - Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer of the developing sympathetic nervous system. 
      High-risk neuroblastoma patients typically undergo an initial remission in response 
      to treatment, followed by recurrence of aggressive tumors that have become 
      refractory to further treatment. The need for biomarkers that can select patients 
      not responding well to therapy in an early phase is therefore needed. In this study, 
      we used next generation sequencing technology to determine the expression profiles 
      in high-risk neuroblastoma cell lines established before and after therapy. Using 
      partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) with least absolute shrinkage 
      and selection operator (LASSO) and leave-one-out cross-validation, we identified a 
      panel of 55 messenger RNAs and 17 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which were 
      significantly altered in the expression between cell lines isolated from primary and 
      recurrent tumors. From a neuroblastoma patient cohort, we found 20 of the 55 
      protein-coding genes to be differentially expressed in patients with unfavorable 
      compared with favorable outcome. We further found a twofold increase or decrease in 
      hazard ratios in these genes when comparing patients with unfavorable and favorable 
      outcome. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that these genes were involved 
      in proliferation, differentiation and regulated by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. Of 
      the 17 lncRNAs, 3 upregulated (NEAT1, SH3BP5-AS1, NORAD) and 3 downregulated lncRNAs 
      (DUBR, MEG3, DHRS4-AS1) were also found to be differentially expressed in favorable 
      compared with unfavorable outcome. Moreover, using expression profiles on both 
      miRNAs and mRNAs in the same cohort of cell lines, we found 13 downregulated and 18 
      upregulated experimentally observed miRNA target genes targeted by miR-21, -424 and 
      -30e, -29b, -138, -494, -181a, -34a, -29b, respectively. The advantage of analyzing 
      biomarkers in a clinically relevant neuroblastoma model system enables further 
      studies on the effect of individual genes upon gene perturbation. In summary, this 
      study identified several genes, which may aid in the prediction of response to 
      therapy and tumor recurrence.

AB  - Bone regeneration is very important for the recovery of some diseases including 
      osteoporosis and bone fracture trauma. It is a multiple-step- and 
      multiple-gene-involved complex process, including the matrix secretion and calcium 
      mineralization by osteoblasts differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and 
      the absorption of calcium and phosphorus by osteoclasts differentiated from 
      hematopoietic stem cells. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a family of transcripts 
      longer than 200 nt without or with very low protein-coding potential. Recent studies 
      have demonstrated that lncRNAs are widely involved in the regulation of lineage 
      commitment and differentiation of stem cells through multiple mechanisms. In this 
      review, we will summarize the roles and molecular mechanism of lncRNAs including 
      H19, MALAT1, MODR, HOTAIR, DANCR, MEG3, HoxA-AS3, and MIAT in osteogenesis 
      ossification; lncRNA ZBED3-AS1 and CTA-941F9.9, DANCR, and HIT in chondrogenic 
      differentiation; and lncRNA DANCR in osteoclast differentiation. These findings will 
      facilitate the development and application of novel molecular drugs which regulate 
      the balance of bone formation and absorption.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Glioma is one of the most common and invasive brain tumors worldwide. 
      Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play an important role in the development of glioma. 
      However, the regulatory mechanism of LncRNAs in glioma has not been fully 
      elucidated. This study aimed to explore the interaction of lncRNA maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (MEG3) and aberrant histone modification in glioma. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The expression levels of MEG3 and miR-21-3p in glioma cells were measured 
      by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) 
      and H3K27me3 expression in glioma cells were detected by Western Blot (WB). The 
      binding site of the promoter of MEG3 by H3K27me3 was confirmed by ChIP-Real-time 
      PCR. The direct target of MEG3 and miR-21-3p in glioma cells was measured by a 
      luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 
      (CCK8), and cell invasion and migration were measured by Transwell assays. RESULTS: 
      EZH2 and miR-21-3p were upregulated and MEG3 was downregulated in glioma cells. 
      Silencing of EZH2 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in U87 and 
      U251 cells. Meanwhile, the expression of H3K27me3 could be significantly inhibited 
      by EZH2 interference. H3K27me3 protein can bind to MEG3 promoter directly. EZH2 
      inhibition and MEG3 down-expression in U87 cells reversed the effects of silencing 
      of EZH2 on glioma cell growth and metastasis. However, EZH2 inhibition and MEG3 
      overexpression in U251 cells restricted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. 
      Furthermore, miR-21-3p was verified to interact with MEG3 by direct binding. 
      Inhibition of MEG3 promoted U87 cell growth and metastasis, which was further 
      strengthened following the co-transfection of si-MEG3 and miR-21-3p. Overexpressed 
      MEG3 inhibited U251 cell growth and metastasis and a complete reversal of the 
      results observed in the co-transfection of LV-MEG3 and miR-21-3p. CONCLUSIONS: EZH2 
      was highly expressed in glioma cells and EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 enrichment on the 
      MEG3 promoter regulated the growth and metastasis of glioma cells by targeting 
      miR-21-3p. It potentially provided a new therapeutic marker targeting glioma.

TI  - MEG3 targets miR-184 and Wnt/β-catenin and modulates properties of osteosarcoma.
PG  - 1901-1912
AB  - Recent studies indicate that MEG3, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and microRNA-184 
      (miR-184) are abnormally expressed in osteosarcoma (OS). To this end, we show here 
      that MEG3 negatively regulates the expression of miR-184 and down-stream effectors 
      of WNT/β-catenin pathway including β-catenin, T-cell factor 4 (TCF4) and c-MYC. MEG3 
      overexpression by adenoviral vectors down-regulate proliferation, migration and 
      apoptosis of OS in vitro and restrict the tumor growth in vivo. We also show that 
      the effects of MEG3 can be effectively reversed by miR-184 mimic. Together these 
      studies show that both MEG3 and miR-184 cooperatively regulate the proliferation, 
      migration and apoptosis of OS.

TI  - MEG3 Suppresses Human Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Cells Growth and Metastasis by 
      Down-Regulation of Mir-183.
PG  - 345-356
LID - 10.1159/000484906 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are rare neoplasms which 
      arise from pancreatic islet cells. Recently, lncRNA MEG3 has been reported as a 
      tumor suppressor in variety cancers. This study aimed to reveal the functional 
      effects of MEG3 on pNETs which has not been uncovered previously. METHODS: The 
      expression of MEG3, miR-183, and BRI3 in BON1 cells were altered by transfection 
      with their specific vectors/shRNA, or mimic/inhibitor. Thereafter, cell viability, 
      apoptosis, the protein expressions of cell cycle related factors, and apoptosis 
      associated factors, as well as cell migration and invasion were respectively 
      assessed by typan blue staining, flow cytometry, western blotting, and transwell 
      assay. RESULTS: MEG3 was low expressed in BON1 and QGP-1 cells, when compared to 
      three normal cell lines (HEK293, CCL-153, and EC-304). MEG3 overexpression decreased 
      BON1 cells viability, invasion, migration, but significantly induced apoptosis. 
      miR-183 was a direct target of MEG3, and miR-183 up-regulation abolished the 
      anti-growth and anti-metastasis effects of MEG3 overexpression on BON1 cells. 
      Moreover, BRI3 was a target of miR-183, and BRI3 exhibited a tumor-promoting role 
      possibly via activation of p38/ERK/AKT and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in BON1 cells. 
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a tumor suppressive effect of MEG3 in BON1 cells 
      that suppresses tumor cells growth and metastasis. A novel regulatory mechanism has 
      been revealed that modulation of MEG3/miR-183/BRI3 axis may be pivotal in pNET.

TI  - Dysfunction of the WT1-MEG3 signaling promotes AML leukemogenesis via p53-dependent 
      and -independent pathways.
PG  - 2543-2551
LID - 10.1038/leu.2017.116 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, exemplified by 
      the recent finding that lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) inhibits tumor 
      growth in a p53-dependent manner. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common 
      malignant myeloid disorder in adults, and TP53 mutations or loss are frequently 
      detected in patients with therapy-related AML or AML with complex karyotype. Here, 
      we reveal that MEG3 is significantly downregulated in AML and suppresses 
      leukemogenesis not only in a p53-dependent, but also a p53-independent manner. In 
      addition, MEG3 is proven to be transcriptionally activated by Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1), 
      dysregulation of which by epigenetic silencing or mutations is causally involved in 
      AML. Therefore MEG3 is identified as a novel target of the WT1 molecule. Ten-eleven 
      translocation-2 (TET2) mutations frequently occur in AML and significantly promote 
      leukemogenesis of this disorder. In our study, TET2, acting as a cofactor of WT1, 
      increases MEG3 expression. Taken together, our work demonstrates that TET2 
      dysregulated WT1-MEG3 axis significantly promotes AML leukemogenesis, paving a new 
      avenue for diagnosis and treatment of AML patients.

TI  - LncRNA MEG3 downregulation mediated by DNMT3b contributes to nickel malignant 
      transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells via modulating PHLPP1 
      transcription and HIF-1α translation.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key factors in various fundamental 
      cellular biological processes, and many of them are likely to have functional roles 
      in tumorigenesis. Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is an imprinted gene located at 
      14q32 that encodes a lncRNA, and the decreased MEG3 expression has been reported in 
      multiple cancer tissues. However, nothing is known about the alteration and role of 
      MEG3 in environmental carcinogen-induced lung tumorigenesis. Our present study, for 
      the first time to the best of our knowledge, discovered that environmental 
      carcinogen nickel exposure led to MEG3 downregulation, consequently initiating 
      c-Jun-mediated PHLPP1 transcriptional inhibition and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α 
      (HIF-1α) protein translation upregulation, in turn resulting in malignant 
      transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells. Mechanistically, MEG3 
      downregulation was attributed to nickel-induced promoter hypermethylation via 
      elevating DNMT3b expression, whereas PHLPP1 transcriptional inhibition was due to 
      the decreasing interaction of MEG3 with its inhibitory transcription factor c-Jun. 
      Moreover, HIF-1α protein translation was upregulated via activating the 
      Akt/p70S6K/S6 axis resultant from PHLPP1 inhibition in nickel responses. 
      Collectively, we uncover that nickel exposure results in DNMT3b induction and MEG3 
      promoter hypermethylation and expression inhibition, further reduces its binding to 
      c-Jun and in turn increasing c-Jun inhibition of PHLPP1 transcription, leading to 
      the Akt/p70S6K/S6 axis activation, and HIF-1α protein translation, as well as 
      malignant transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells. Our studies provide a 
      significant insight into understanding the alteration and role of MEG3 in 
      nickel-induced lung tumorigenesis.

AB  - Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reversed process 
      mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) play a critical role in epithelial 
      plasticity during development and cancer progression. Among important regulators of 
      these cellular processes are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The imprinted DLK1-DIO3 
      locus, containing numerous maternally expressed ncRNAs including the lncRNA 
      maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) and a cluster of over 50 miRNAs, has been shown 
      to be a modulator of stemness in embryonic stem cells and in cancer progression, 
      potentially through the tumor suppressor role of MEG3. In this study we analyzed the 
      expression pattern and functional role of ncRNAs from the DLK1-DIO3 locus in 
      epithelial plasticity of the breast. We studied their expression in various cell 
      types of breast tissue and revisit the role of the locus in EMT/MET using a breast 
      epithelial progenitor cell line (D492) and its isogenic mesenchymal derivative 
      (D492M). Marked upregulation of ncRNAs from the DLK1-DIO3 locus was seen after EMT 
      induction in two cell line models of EMT. In addition, the expression of MEG3 and 
      the maternally expressed ncRNAs was higher in stromal cells compared to epithelial 
      cell types in primary breast tissue. We also show that expression of MEG3 is 
      concomitant with the expression of the ncRNAs from the DLK1-DIO3 locus and its 
      expression is therefore likely indicative of activation of all ncRNAs at the locus. 
      MEG3 expression is correlated with stromal markers in normal tissue and breast 
      cancer tissue and negatively correlated with the survival of breast cancer patients 
      in two different cohorts. Overexpression of MEG3 using CRISPR activation in a breast 
      epithelial cell line induced partial EMT and enriched for a basal-like phenotype. 
      Conversely, knock down of MEG3 using CRISPR inhibition in a mesenchymal cell line 
      reduced the mesenchymal and basal-like phenotype of the cell line. In summary our 
      study shows that maternally expressed ncRNAs are markers of EMT and suggests that 
      MEG3 is a novel regulator of EMT/MET in breast tissue. Nevertheless, further studies 
      are needed to fully dissect the molecular pathways influenced by non-coding RNAs at 
      the DLK1-DIO3 locus in breast tissue.

AB  - Maternally expressed gene 3 (Meg3), a long non-coding RNA, has been reported to be 
      associated with the pathogenesis of multiple malignancies. However, little is known 
      regarding the role of Meg3 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In this study, we 
      found that the expression of Meg3 was lower in epithelial ovarian carcinoma, and has 
      potential to be considered as a biomarker for ovarian cancer. After transfecting the 
      ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR3 and A2780 with Meg3, phenotypic changes and 
      autophagy-related molecules were examined. Upregulation of Meg3 inhibited cell 
      proliferation, plate colony formation, induced cell cycle arrest in G2 phases, and 
      promoted apoptosis. Observation of autophagosomes was performed by transmission 
      electron microscopy. The expression levels of LC3-II, ATG3, LAMP1 were elevated, 
      while SQSTM1/p62 expression declined. Upregulated expression of Meg3 also suppressed 
      tumorigenesis in vivo in a xenograft mouse model through upregulating ATG3 
      expression. RIP (ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation) and RNA pull-down assays 
      showed that Meg3 was co-immunoprecipitated with ATG3. In addition, Meg3 protected 
      ATG3 mRNA from degradation following treatment with actinomycin D. Overall, our 
      results suggest that the lncRNA Meg3 acts as a tumor suppressor in EOC by regulating 
      ATG3 activity and inducing autophagy.

      Choriocarcinoma.
PG  - e931475
LID - 10.12659/MSM.931475 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Numerous studies have demonstrated that noncoding RNAs are involved in 
      choriocarcinoma (CC). The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network plays an 
      important role in the occurrence and development of carcinoma. However, the 
      involvement of the ceRNA network in CC remains unclear. The current study aimed to 
      investigate the regulatory mechanism of ceRNA in CC. MATERIAL AND METHODS We 
      downloaded the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) expression profiles (GSE20510 and GSE65654) 
      and microRNAs (miRNAs) expression profiles (GSE32346 and GSE130489) from GEO 
      datasets. The limma package of R software was used to identify differentially 
      expressed RNAs (DERNAs). Then, we performed functional annotation of the 
      differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs). TargetScan, miRDB, miRWalk, and Starbase 
      were used to construct a CC-specific ceRNA network and select key molecules. RESULTS 
      The results identified a total of 177 DEmRNAs and 189 differentially expressed 
      miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) between the trophoblast and CC cell line samples. Ten 
      differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) were obtained based on experimental 
      studies. The DEmRNAs were mainly enriched in cell proliferation, positive regulation 
      of the apoptotic process, and cell death. A total of 10 genes were ascertained as 
      hub genes. Based on DEmRNAs, DEmiRNAs, and DElncRNAs, a CC-specific ceRNA network 
      was established. Five DElncRNAs, 15 DEmiRNAs, and 45 DEmRNAs were identified. In 
      addition, LINC00261, MEG3, MALAT1, H19, and OGFRP1 were identified as 5 key lncRNAs 
      in choriocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS This study provides novel insights into CC 
      mechanisms and identified potential therapeutic targets for CC.

AB  - Colorectal cancer is one of the commoner digestive tract malignant tumor types, and

      other by competing with the same micro(mi)RNA response element (MREs) and serve an 
      important role in the regulation of gene expression in a variety of tumor types. 
      However, the regulatory mechanism and prognostic role of lncRNA‑mediated competing 
      endogenous (ce)RNA networks in colon cancer have yet to be elucidated. The 
      expression profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs from 471 colon cancer and 41 
      paracancerous tissue samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. 
      A lncRNA‑miRNA‑mRNA ceRNA network in colon cancer was constructed and comprised 17 
      hub lncRNAs, 87 hub miRNA and 144 hub mRNAs. The topological properties of the 
      network were analyzed, and the random walk algorithm was used to identify the nodes 
      significantly associated with colon cancer. Survival analysis using the UALCAN 
      database indicated that 2/17 lncRNAs identified [metastasis‑associated lung 
      adenocarcinoma transcript (MALAT1) and maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3)] and 5/144 
      mRNAs [FES upstream region (FURIN), nuclear factor of activated T‑cells 5 (NFAT5), 
      RNA Binding Motif Protein 12B (RBM12B), Ras related GTP binding A (RRAGA) and WD 
      repeat domain phosphoinositide‑interacting protein 2 (WIPI2)] were significantly 
      associated with the overall survival of patients with colon cancer, and may 
      therefore be used as potential prognostic biomarkers of colon cancer. According to 
      extracted lncRNA‑miRNA‑mRNA interaction pairs, the GSE26334 dataset was used to 
      confirm that the lncRNA MALAT1/miR‑129‑5p/NFAT5 axis may represent a novel 
      regulatory mechanism concerning the progression of colon cancer. The clusterProfiler 
      package was used to analyze Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes (KEGG) pathways in colon cancer. Finally, drugs that significantly interact 
      with the core genes identified in colon cancer were predicted using a hypergeometric 
      test. Of these, fostamatinib was identified to be a targeted drug for colon cancer 
      therapy. The present findings provide a novel perspective for improved understanding 
      of the lncRNA‑associated ceRNA network and may facilitate the development of novel 
      targeted therapeutics in colon cancer.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation of long non-coding RNA 
      maternally expressed gene 3 (Lnc-MEG3) with disease features, treatment response, 
      and survival in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.Among 92 de novo 
      pediatric AML patients (before treatment and after 1 course of induction) and 40 
      controls, bone marrow mononuclear cells were obtained. Then, Lnc-MEG3 expression was 
      determined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. After 1 
      course of standard induction therapy of pediatric AML patients, complete remission 
      (CR) was assessed. Furthermore, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) 
      were determined according to follow-up data.Lnc-MEG3 was reduced in pediatric AML 
      patients compared with controls. In pediatric AML patients, Lnc-MEG3 was correlated 
      with French-American-Britain subtypes and lower Chinese Medical Association risk 
      stratification, while it was not associated with cytogenetic features, FLT3-ITD 
      mutation, CEBPA mutation, NPM1 mutation, WT1 mutation, or National Comprehensive 
      Cancer Network risk stratification. After 1 course of treatment, Lnc-MEG3 exhibited 
      an up-regulation trend. Furthermore, Lnc-MEG3 was of no difference before treatment 
      between patients with and without CR, while elevated Lnc-MEG3 and change of Lnc-MEG3 
      after 1 course of treatment were associated with increased CR rate. Additionally, 
      increased Lnc-MEG3 expression before treatment was associated with longer EFS but 
      not OS, while enhanced Lnc-MEG3 expression after 1 course of treatment was 
      correlated with both prolonged EFS and OS.Lnc-MEG3 may have clinical significance as 
      a biomarker for assisting with disease management, treatment optimization, and 
      prognosis improvement in pediatric AML patients.

AB  - Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is a tumor 
      suppressor in several cancers, such as glioma, prostate cancer and esophageal 
      cancer. However, the role of MEG3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the related 
      molecular mechanisms are not well understood. The present study aimed to determine 
      the biological function of MEG3 in regulating HCC cell viability, apoptosis and 
      migration. In addition, the interaction between MEG3, microRNA (miR)-9-5p and 
      Midkine (MDK), and the activation of the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK)/AKT 
      pathway in HCC cell line MHCC-97L were examined. Luciferase reporter assays, reverse 
      transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting were used to determine the 
      interaction between MEG3, miR-9-5p and MDK and the activation of the PDK/AKT 
      pathway. Cell viability was determined by the CCK8 assay and the cell cycle analysis 
      using flow cytometry analysis. Cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry 
      analysis and caspase 3/9 activity. Wound healing assays and western blotting were 
      used to investigate cell migration. The present study demonstrated that MEG3 
      suppressed HCC cell viability and migration, and induced cell apoptosis. In 
      addition, it was also found that MEG3 targets the miR-9-5p/MDK axis and modulates 
      the PDK/AKT pathway in HCC. In conclusion, the findings of the present study 
      demonstrated that lncRNA MEG3 affects HCC cell viability, apoptosis and migration 
      through its targeting of miR-9-5p/MDK and regulation of the PDK/AKT pathway. The 
      MEG3/miR-9-5p/MDK axis may be a potential therapeutic target in HCC.

AB  - The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a tumor 
      suppressor, is critical for the carcinogenesis and progression of different cancers, 
      including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, the roles of lncRNA MEG3 in HCC 
      are not well illustrated. Therefore, this study used western blot and qRT-PCR to 
      evaluate the expression of MEG3, miR-9-5p, and Sex determining Region Y-related 
      HMG-box 11 (SOX11) in HCC tissues and cell lines. RNA pull-down and luciferase 
      reporter assay were used to evaluate these molecular interactions. 
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and flow cytometry 
      detected the viability and apoptosis of HCC cells, respectively. The results showed 
      that MEG3 and SOX11 were poorly expressed but miR-9-5p was highly expressed in HCC. 
      The expression levels of these molecules suggested a negative correlation between 
      MEG3 and miR-9-5p and a positive correlation with SOX11, confirmed by Pearson's 
      correlation analysis and biology experiments. Furthermore, MEG3 could combine with 
      miR-9-5p, and SOX11 was a direct target of miR-9-5p. Moreover, MEG3 over-expression 
      promoted cell apoptosis and growth inhibition in HCC cells through sponging miR-9-5p 
      to up-regulate SOX11. Therefore, the interactions among MEG3, miR-9-5p, and SOX11 
      might offer a novel insight for understanding HCC pathogeny and provide potential 
      diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for HCC.

TI  - World Workshop on Oral Medicine VII: Clinical evidence of differential expression of 
      lncRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma: A scoping review.
PG  - 88-101
LID - 10.1111/odi.13076 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have important roles in regulating gene 
      expression pertaining to cell proliferation, survival, migration and genomic 
      stability. Dysregulated expression of lncRNAs is implicated in cancer initiation, 
      progression and metastasis. OBJECTIVES: To explore, map and summarize the extent of 
      evidence from clinical studies investigating the differential expression of lncRNAs 
      in oral/tongue squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science 
      were used as search engines. Clinical, full-length, English language studies were 
      included. PRISMA-ScR protocol was used to evaluate and present results. The present 
      scoping review summarizes relationships of the differential expression of lncRNAs 
      with the presence of tumour and with clinicopathological features including 
      survival. RESULTS: Almost half of the investigated transcripts have been explored in 
      more than one study, yet not always with consistent results. The collected data were 
      also compared to the limited studies investigating oral epithelial dysplasia. Data 
      are not easily comparable, first because of different methods used to define what 
      differential expression is, and second because only a limited number of studies 
      performed multivariate analyses to identify clinicopathological features associated 
      with the differentially expressed lncRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Standard methods and more 
      appropriate data analyses are needed in order to achieve reliable results from 
      future studies.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate how long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (MEG3) inhibits the growth and metastasis of oral squamous cell 
      carcinoma (OSCC) by regulating WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway in order to explore 
      the antitumor effect of MEG3 and to provide a potential molecular target for the 
      treatment of OSCC. The RT-qPCR technique was used to quantitatively analyze the 
      expression of MEG3 in cancer and adjacent tissues collected from the patients after 
      surgery. Using the Lipofectamine method, the MEG3 overexpression vector and the 
      siRNA interference vector were constructed and transfected into SCC15 and Cal27 
      cells, respectively, followed by cell proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis 
      analyses. The semi-quantitative analysis of the expression of the β-catenin protein 
      in transfected cells was performed by the western blot analysis, and the activity of 
      the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway was analyzed using the TOP/FOP flash reporters. 
      In addition, the cells were treated with decitabine to investigate the correlation 
      between the MEG3 expression and the DNA methylation. Results showed that the 
      expression level of MEG3 was significantly decreased in OSCC (p<0.05) and 
      overexpression of MEG3 inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells 
      and promoted apoptosis. Importantly, MEG3 played a role as a tumor suppressor by 
      inhibiting the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, the expression of the 
      MEG3 was significantly affected by the degree of DNA methylation. It was concluded 
      that the lncRNA MEG3 can inhibit the growth and metastasis of OSCC by negatively 
      regulating the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway.

AB  - Regulatory pathways involving non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNAs) 
      and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), have gained great relevance due to their role in 
      the control of gene expression modulation. Using RNA sequencing of KSHV Bac36 
      transfected mouse endothelial cells (mECK36) and tumors, we have analyzed the host 
      and viral transcriptome to uncover the role lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA driven networks in 
      KSHV tumorigenesis. The integration of the differentially expressed ncRNAs, with an 
      exhaustive computational analysis of their experimentally supported targets, led us 
      to dissect complex networks integrated by the cancer-related lncRNAs Malat1, Neat1, 
      H19, Meg3, and their associated miRNA-target pairs. These networks would modulate 
      pathways related to KSHV pathogenesis, such as viral carcinogenesis, p53 signaling, 
      RNA surveillance, and cell cycle control. Finally, the ncRNA-mRNA analysis allowed 
      us to develop signatures that can be used to an appropriate identification of 
      druggable gene or networks defining relevant AIDS-KS therapeutic targets.

TI  - Functional characterization of DLK1/MEG3 locus on chromosome 14q32.2 reveals the 
      differentiation of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors.
PG  - 1422-1439
LID - 10.18632/aging.202376 [doi]
AB  - Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) represent the neoplastic proliferation of 
      the anterior pituitary gland. Transcription factors play a key role in the 
      differentiation of PitNETs. However, for a substantial proportion of PitNETs, the 
      etiology is poorly understood. According to the transcription data of 172 patients, 
      we found the imprinting disorders of the 14q32.2 region and DLK1/MEG3 locus 
      associated with the differentiation of PitNETs. DLK1/MEG3 locus promoted somatotroph 
      differentiation and inhibited tumor proliferation in PIT1(+) patients, furthermore, 
      the level of DLK1 played a critical role in the trend of somatotroph or lactotroph 
      differentiation. Anti-DLK1 monoclonal antibody blockade or siMEG3 both indicated 
      that the DLK1/MEG3 significantly promoted the synthesis and secretion of GH/IGF-1 
      and inhibited cell proliferation. In addition, loss of DLK1 activated the mTOR 
      signaling pathway in high DLK1-expressing and PIT1(+) GH3 cell lines, a mild effect 
      in the low DLK1-expressing and PIT1(+) MMQ cell lines and no effect in the PIT1(-) 
      ATT20 cell line. These findings emphasize that expression at the DLK1/MEG3 locus 
      plays a key role in the differentiation of PitNETs, especially somatotroph adenomas, 
      and provide potential molecular target data for patient stratification and treatment 
      in the future.

TI  - Integrative analysis identifies lincRNAs up- and downstream of neuroblastoma driver 
      genes.

AB  - Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as integral components of 
      signaling pathways in various cancer types. In neuroblastoma, only a handful of 
      lincRNAs are known as upstream regulators or downstream effectors of oncogenes. 
      Here, we exploit RNA sequencing data of primary neuroblastoma tumors, neuroblast 
      precursor cells, neuroblastoma cell lines and various cellular perturbation model 
      systems to define the neuroblastoma lincRNome and map lincRNAs up- and downstream of 
      neuroblastoma driver genes MYCN, ALK and PHOX2B. Each of these driver genes controls 
      the expression of a particular subset of lincRNAs, several of which are associated 
      with poor survival and are differentially expressed in neuroblastoma tumors compared 
      to neuroblasts. By integrating RNA sequencing data from both primary tumor tissue 
      and cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that several of these lincRNAs are expressed 
      in stromal cells. Deconvolution of primary tumor gene expression data revealed a 
      strong association between stromal cell composition and driver gene status, 
      resulting in differential expression of these lincRNAs. We also explored lincRNAs 
      that putatively act upstream of neuroblastoma driver genes, either as presumed 
      modulators of driver gene activity, or as modulators of effectors regulating driver 
      gene expression. This analysis revealed strong associations between the 
      neuroblastoma lincRNAs MIAT and MEG3 and MYCN and PHOX2B activity or expression. 
      Together, our results provide a comprehensive catalogue of the neuroblastoma 
      lincRNome, highlighting lincRNAs up- and downstream of key neuroblastoma driver 
      genes. This catalogue forms a solid basis for further functional validation of 
      candidate neuroblastoma lincRNAs.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulatory molecules in various 
      biological and pathological processes, including cancer development. We have 
      previously shown that the MEG3 lncRNA plays an essential role in transforming growth 
      factor-β (TGF-β)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human lung 
      cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the function of another lncRNA, MEG8, 
      which shares the DLK1-DIO3 locus with MEG3, in the regulation of EMT. MEG8 lncRNA 
      expression was immediately induced during TGF-β-mediated EMT of A549 and LC2/ad lung 
      cancer and Panc1 pancreatic cancer cell lines. MEG8 overexpression specifically 
      suppressed the expression of microRNA-34a and microRNA-203 genes, resulting in 
      up-regulation of SNAIL family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAI1) and SNAI2 
      transcription factors, which repressed expression of cadherin 1 (CDH1)/E-cadherin. 
      Mechanistic investigations revealed that MEG8 associates with enhancer of zeste 2 
      polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) protein and induces its recruitment to 
      the regulatory regions of the two microRNA genes for histone H3 methylation and 
      transcriptional repression. Interestingly, expression of both MEG8 and MEG3, but not 
      each individually, could induce EMT-related cell morphological changes and increased 
      cell motility in the absence of TGF-β by activating the gene expression program 
      required for EMT. MEG8 knockdown indicated that endogenous MEG8 lncRNA is 
      indispensable for TGF-β-induced EMT in A549 lung cancer and Panc1 pancreatic cancer 
      cells. Our findings indicate that MEG8 lncRNA significantly contributes to 
      epigenetic EMT induction and increase our understanding of the lncRNA-mediated 
      regulatory mechanisms involved in malignant progression of cancer.

LID - 10.21873/cgp.20301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is frequent among children. Few 
      studies have researched the relationship between maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) 
      and cancer risk. We hypothesized long non-coding RNA MEG3 polymorphisms might 
      influence the risk of childhood ALL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a total of 266 
      patients with childhood ALL and 266 healthy controls, genotypes of MEG3 rs7158663, 
      rs3087918, rs11160608 and rs4081134 single nucleotide polymorphisms were 
      investigated for their associations with childhood ALL. RESULTS: MEG3 rs7158663 AG 
      and AA genotypes were significantly associated with ALL [odds ratio=1.61 (95% 
      confidence interval=1.12-2.31) and 2.21 (1.16-4.22), respectively]. The A allele 
      also exhibited a statistical association with higher risk of ALL (p=0.0015). There 
      was no positive association as for rs3087918, rs11160608 or rs4081134. 
      Interestingly, a significant interaction between MEG3 rs7158663 and age (≥3.5 years) 
      and gender (male) was found. CONCLUSION: MEG3 rs7158663 AG/AA genotypes were 
      associated with higher susceptibility to childhood ALL. These novel findings should 
      be validated in larger populations and different ethnicities.

TI  - Long non-coding RNA MEG3 suppresses the development of bladder urothelial carcinoma 
      by regulating miR-96 and TPM1.
PG  - 1039-1056
LID - 10.1080/15384047.2018.1480279 [doi]
AB  - We aimed at investigating effects of long non-coding RNA maternally expressed 3 
      (MEG3) on the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of bladder urothelial 
      carcinoma cells and regulatory relationships among lncRNA MEG3, miR-96 and 
      α-tropomyosin 1 (TPM1). Human clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
      which contains bladder urothelial carcinoma tissues and adjacent tissues were used 
      for analysis. The expression profiles of MEG3, miR-96, TPM1, cell cycle-related 
      genes and apoptosis-related genes were examined by real-time quantitative polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot. Regulating relationship among MEG3, 
      miR-96 and TPM1 was confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay. MTT assay and flow 
      cytometry were performed to observe cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. 
      The effects of lncRNA MEG3 on bladder urothelial carcinoma were confirmed both in 
      vivo and in vitro. The mRNA expression and protein expression of MEG3, TPM1 were 
      down-regulated in carcinoma tissues, whereas miR-96 expression was up-regulated. 
      MEG3 overexpression resulted in miR-96 downregulation along with TPM1 upregulation, 
      which inhibited cell proliferation and cell cycle but promoted cell apoptosis of 
      bladder urothelial carcinoma cells in vitro, and at the same time inhibited tumor 
      growth in vivo. In this process, expressions of apoptosis-related protein BCL2 
      associated X (Bax), cleaved-caspase 3 was up-regulated, whereas apoptosis regulator 
      protein (Bcl-2) expression was suppressed when MEG3 was overexpressed, and cell 
      cycle-related protein Cyclin D1 was down-regulated. LncRNA MEG3 low-expression 
      promotes the proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of bladder urothelial carcinoma 
      cells by regulating miR-96 along with TPM1.

AB  - Although doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anti-cancer drug with cytotoxicity in a 
      variety of different tumors, its effectiveness in treating glioblastoma multiforme 
      (GBM) is constrained by insufficient penetration across the blood-brain barrier 
      (BBB). In this study, biocompatible magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) 
      stabilized with trimethoxysilylpropyl-ethylenediamine triacetic acid (EDT) were 
      developed as a carrier of DOX for GBM chemotherapy. The DOX-loaded EDT-IONPs 
      (DOX-EDT-IONPs) released DOX within 4 days with the capability of an accelerated 
      release in acidic microenvironments. The DOX-loaded EDT-IONPs (DOX-EDT-IONPs) 
      demonstrated an efficient uptake in mouse brain-derived microvessel endothelial, 
      bEnd.3, Madin-Darby canine kidney transfected with multi-drug resistant protein 1 
      (MDCK-MDR1), and human U251 GBM cells. The DOX-EDT-IONPs could augment DOX's uptake 
      in U251 cells by 2.8-fold and significantly inhibited U251 cell proliferation. 
      Moreover, the DOX-EDT-IONPs were found to be effective in apoptotic-induced GBM cell 
      death (over 90%) within 48 h of treatment. Gene expression studies revealed a 
      significant downregulation of TOP II and Ku70, crucial enzymes for DNA repair and 
      replication, as well as MiR-155 oncogene, concomitant with an upregulation of 
      caspase 3 and tumor suppressors i.e., p53, MEG3 and GAS5, in U251 cells upon 
      treatment with DOX-EDT-IONPs. An in vitro MDCK-MDR1-GBM co-culture model was used to 
      assess the BBB permeability and anti-tumor activity of the DOX-EDT-IONPs and DOX 
      treatments. While DOX-EDT-IONP showed improved permeability of DOX across MDCK-MDR1 
      monolayers compared to DOX alone, cytotoxicity in U251 cells was similar in both 
      treatment groups. Using a cadherin binding peptide (ADTC5) to transiently open tight 
      junctions, in combination with an external magnetic field, significantly 
      enhanced both DOX-EDT-IONP permeability and cytotoxicity in the MDCK-MDR1-GBM 
      co-culture model. Therefore, the combination of magnetic enhanced convective 
      diffusion and the cadherin binding peptide for transiently opening the BBB tight 
      junctions are expected to enhance the efficacy of GBM chemotherapy using the 
      DOX-EDT-IONPs. In general, the developed approach enables the chemotherapeutic to 
      overcome both BBB and multidrug resistance (MDR) glioma cells while providing 
      site-specific magnetic targeting.

AB  - Bladder Cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. Recent studies 
      show that non-coding RNAs such as lncRNAs and circRNAs play critical roles in the 
      progression of this cancer, but their regulatory relationships and functions are 
      still largely unknown. As a new regulatory process within the cell, the coding and 
      non-coding RNAs compete with each other to sponge their target miRNAs. This 
      mechanism is described as "the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis" which 
      provides a new perspective to understand the regulation of gene expression in health 
      and diseases such as cancer. In this study, to investigate the role of non-coding 
      RNAs in BC, a new approach was used to reconstruct the ceRNA network for Non-Muscle 
      Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) based on the expression data of coding and 
      non-coding genes. Analysis of ceRNA networks in the early stage of BC led to the 
      detection of an important module containing the lncRNA MEG3 as the central gene. The 
      results show that the lncRNAs CARMN, FENDRR and ADAMTS9-AS2 may regulate MEG3 in 
      NMIBC through sponging some important miRNAs such as miR-143-3p, miR-106a-5p and 
      miR-34a-3p. Also, the lncRNA AC007608.2 is shown to be a potential BC related lncRNA 
      for the first time based on ceRNA stage-specific network analysis. Furthermore, hub 
      and altered genes in stage-specific and between stage networks led to the detection 
      of hsa_circ_0017586 and hsa_circ_0001741 as novel potential circRNAs related to 
      NMIBC. Finally, the hub genes in the networks were shown to be valuable candidates 
      as biomarkers for the early stage diagnosis of BC.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as major players in 
      regulating various biological processes. LncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA 
      (Hotair) has been extensively studied in cancer. However, the role of Hotair in 
      liver fibrosis remains unknown. Here we observed that Hotair expression was 
      significantly increased in CCl(4)-induced mouse liver fibrosis models, human 
      fibrotic livers and activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by TGF-β1 stimulation. 
      Enforced expression of Hotair in LX-2 cells promoted cell proliferation and 
      activation while inhibition of its expression had an opposite effect. Furthermore, 
      we found that Hotair may act as an endogenous 'sponge' of miR-148b, which regulates 
      expression of the DNMT1/MEG3/p53 pathways in HSCs. Intriguingly, Hotair enhanced 
      polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) occupancy and histone H3K27me3 repressive 
      marks, specifically at the MEG3 promoter region. Finally, we found that Hotair forms 
      an RNA/DNA hybrid and recruits PRC2 to MEG3 promoter. These data suggest that Hotair 
      inhibition may represent a promising therapeutic option for suppressing liver 
      fibrosis.

AB  - Animal experiments have demonstrated that diets high in fats create a harmful 
      environment for developing sperm cells, contributing to impaired reproductive health 
      and induced risk for chronic diseases in the next generation. Changes at the level 
      of the epigenome have been suggested to underlie these observations. Human data are 
      limited to verify this hypothesis. While we earlier demonstrated a link between male 
      obesity and DNA methylation changes at imprinted genes in mature sperm cells and 
      newborns, it is currently unknown if -or how- a paternal eating pattern (related to 
      obesity) is related to indices for epigenetic inheritance. We here aim to examine a 
      yet unexplored link between consumption of healthy (rich in vitamins and fibers) or 
      unhealthy ("fast") foods and methylation at imprint regulatory regions in DNA of 
      sperm. We obtained semen and data from 67 men, as part of a North Carolina-based 
      study: The Influence of the Environment on Gametic Epigenetic Reprogramming (TIEGER) 
      study. Dietary data included intake of fruits/nuts, vegetables/soups, whole grain 
      bread, meat, seafood/fish, and fatty or processed food items. Multiple regression 
      models were used to explore the association between dietary habits and clinical 
      sperm parameters as well as DNA methylation levels, quantified using bisulfite 
      pyrosequencing at 12 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the following 
      imprinted genes: GRB10, IGF2, H19, MEG3, NDN, NNAT, PEG1/MEST, PEG3, PLAGL1, SNRPN, 
      and SGCE/PEG10. After adjusting for age, obesity status and recruitment method, we 
      found that Total Motile Count (TMC) was significantly higher if men consumed 
      fruits/nuts (β=+6.9, SE=1.9, p=0.0005) and vegetables (β=+5.4, SE=1.9, p=0.006), 
      whereas consumption of fries was associated with lower TMC (β=-20.2, SE=8.7, 
      p=0.024). Semen volume was also higher if vegetables or fruits/nuts were frequently 
      consumed (β=+0.06, SE=0.03, p=0.03). Similarly, our sperm epigenetic analyses showed 
      opposing associations for healthy versus fast food items. Frequent consumption of 
      fries was related to a higher chance of sperm being methylated at the MEG3-IG CpG4 
      site (OR=1.073, 95%CI: 1.035-1.112), and high consumption of vegetables was 
      associated with a lower risk of DNA methylation at the NNAT CpG3 site (OR=0.941, 
      95%CI: 0.914-0.968). These results remained significant after adjusting for multiple 
      testing. We conclude that dietary habits are linked to sperm epigenetic outcomes. If 
      carried into the next generation paternal unhealthy dietary patterns may result in 
      adverse metabolic conditions and increased risk for chronic diseases in offspring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The feces of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients contain tumor colonocytes, 
      which constantly shed into the lumen area. Therefore, stool evaluation can be 
      considered as a rapid and low-risk way to directly determine the colon and rectum 
      status. As long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) alterations are important in cancer cells 
      fate regulation, we aimed to assess the level of a panel of cancer-related lncRNAs 
      in fecal colonocytes. METHODS: The population study consisted of 150 subjects, 
      including a training set, a validation set, and a group of 30 colon polyps. The 
      expression levels of lncRNAs were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). 
      The NPInetr and EnrichR tools were used to identify the interactions and functions 
      of lncRNAs. RESULTS: A total of 10 significantly dysregulated lncRNAs, including 
      CCAT1, CCAT2, H19, HOTAIR, HULC, MALAT1, PCAT1, MEG3, PTENP1, and TUSC7, were chosen 
      for designing a predictive panel. The diagnostic performance of the panel in 
      distinguishing CRCs from the healthy group was AUC: 0.8554 in the training set and 
      0.8465 in the validation set. The AUC for early CRCs (I-II TNM stages) was 0.8554 in 
      the training set and 0.8465 in the validation set, and for advanced CRCs (III-IV TNM 
      stages) were 0.9281 in the training set and 0.9236 in the validation set. The 
      corresponding AUC for CRCs vs polyps were 0.9228 (I-IV TNM stages), 0.9042 (I-II TNM 
      stages), and 0.9362 (III-IV TNM stages). CONCLUSIONS: These data represented the 
      application of analysis of fecal colonocytes lncRNAs in early detection of CRC.

AB  - Liver metastasis is the primary cause of death for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. 
      To investigate the prognostic value of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) on colorectal 
      liver metastases, quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (quantitative RT-PCR) was 
      performed on 15 lncRNAs in 51 stage IV CRC with liver metastases and 57 stage I/II 
      CRC specimens. The expression levels of four lncRNAs (GAS5, H19, MEG3 and Yiya) were 
      significantly different between liver metastases and primary tumors of stage IV CRC 
      patients. Furthermore, the high expression levels of GAS5 and Yiya were 
      significantly associated with future occurrence of liver metastases in early stage 
      CRC patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression levels of GAS5 
      or Yiya were correlated with poor prognosis of early stage CRC patients (p = 0.0206 
      and 0.0005 for GAS5 and Yiya, respectively). Yiya expression was proved to be an 
      independent prognostic indicator of colorectal liver metastases in a multivariate 
      analysis (relative risk = 10.7; p < 0.0001). Our study revealed that GAS5 and Yiya 
      were promising prognostic biomarkers of liver metastases for early stage CRC 
      patients.

AB  - Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a highly prevalent cancer in AIDS patients, especially in 
      sub-Saharan Africa. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the 
      etiological agent of KS and other cancers like Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL). In 
      KS and PEL, all tumors harbor latent KSHV episomes and express latency-associated 
      viral proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs). The exact molecular mechanisms by which 
      latent KSHV drives tumorigenesis are not completely understood. Recent developments 
      have highlighted the importance of aberrant long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression 
      in cancer. Deregulation of lncRNAs by miRNAs is a newly described phenomenon. We 
      hypothesized that KSHV-encoded miRNAs deregulate human lncRNAs to drive 
      tumorigenesis. We performed lncRNA expression profiling of endothelial cells 
      infected with wt and miRNA-deleted KSHV and identified 126 lncRNAs as putative viral 
      miRNA targets. Here we show that KSHV deregulates host lncRNAs in both a 
      miRNA-dependent fashion by direct interaction and in a miRNA-independent fashion 
      through latency-associated proteins. Several lncRNAs that were previously implicated 
      in cancer, including MEG3, ANRIL and UCA1, are deregulated by KSHV. Our results also 
      demonstrate that KSHV-mediated UCA1 deregulation contributes to increased 
      proliferation and migration of endothelial cells.

AB  - CACX is one of the most common cancer affecting women world-wide. Here, expression 
      microarray analysis revealed 8 over-expressed transcribed pseudogenes (GBP1P1, 
      HLA-DRB6, HLA-H, SLC6A10P, NAPSB, KRT16P2, PTTG3P and RNF126P1), down-regulated 7 
      lincRNAs (H19, MIR100HG, MEG3, DIO3OS, HOXA11-AS, CD27-AS1 and EPB41L4A-AS) and 6 
      snoRNAs (SNORD97, SNORD3A, SNORD3C, SNORD3D, SNORA12 and SCARNA9) as DEncGs (log2 
      fold-change ≥ ±1.0) in CACX. Consequently, down-regulation of lincRNA MEG3 and 
      over-expression of pseudogenes, GBP1P1 and PTTG3P in the microarray analysis were 
      found concordant with the real-time quantitative PCR results upon validation. Then, 
      Ingenuity® Pathway analysis (IPA®) analysis with deregulated DEncGs identified 
      functionally important gene, H19. Further, validation (n = 52) of expression 
      confirmed frequent downregulation of H19 with significant association with its 
      deletion (LOH) and promoter methylation (n = 128) in CACX. Moreover, 
      clinicopathological analysis found Indian CACX patients (n = 26) with alterations of 
      H19 by deletion or, promoter methylation with concomitant low expression have poor 
      prognosis.

TI  - Metabolic changes during malignant transformation in primary cells of oral lichen 
      planus: Succinate accumulation and tumour suppression.
PG  - 1179-1188

AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is usually diagnosed at late stages, which leads 
      to high morbidity. There are evidence that chronic inflammation (eg oral lichen 
      planus [OLP]) was a risk factor of OSCC, but often misdiagnosed or ignored until 
      invasion and metastasis. By applying precision medicine, the molecular 
      microenvironment variations and relevant biomarkers for the malignant transformation 
      from OLP to OSCC can be fully investigated. Several studies pointed out that the 
      metabolic pathway were suppressed in OSCC. However, it remains unclear how the 
      systemic profile of the metabolites change during the malignant transformation. In 
      this study, we examined and compared the mucosa samples from 11 healthy individuals, 
      10 OLP patients and 21 OSCC patients. Based on the results, succinate, a key 
      metabolite of the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway, was accumulated in the primary 
      cultured precancerous OLP keratinocytes and OSCC cells. Then, we found that 
      succinate activated the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) pathway and 
      induced apoptosis, which could also be up-regulated by the tumour suppressor lncRNA 
      MEG3. These results suggested the critical roles of succinate and MEG3 in the 
      metabolic changes during malignant transformation from OLP to OSCC, which indicated 
      that succinate, HIF1α and downstream proteins might serve as new biomarkers of 
      precancerous OLP for early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. In addition, 
      succinate or its prodrugs might become a potential therapy for the prevention or 
      treatment of OSCC.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the aberrantly expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in 
      ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). METHODS: Total RNA was isolated in HGSC 
      cell lines, ovarian surface epithelial cells, and normal ovaries. Aberrantly 
      expressed lncRNAs in HGSC were identified by PCR array, which analyzes 84 kinds of 
      lncRNAs. To infer their functions, HGSC cell lines with different levels of 
      expression of the identified lncRNAs were established, and then, activities of 
      proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were examined. Expression levels of the 
      identified lncRNAs were also examined in multiple ovarian HGSC tissues. RESULTS: Ten 
      aberrantly expressed lncRNAs, six upregulated and four downregulated, were 
      identified in the HGSC cell lines. The authors established four HGSC cell lines: in 
      two of the cell lines, one of the upregulated lncRNAs was knocked down, and in two 
      other cell lines, one of the downregulated lncRNAs (MEG3 and POU5F1P5) was 
      overexpressed. Migration activities were inhibited in the HGSC cell lines 
      overexpressing MEG3 or POU5F1P5 while there were no differences in proliferation and 
      apoptosis between the established and control cell lines. The four lncRNAs 
      downregulated in the HGSC cell lines were also observed to be downregulated in 
      ovarian HGSC tissues. CONCLUSION: The authors identified four downregulated lncRNAs 
      in ovarian HGSC.

TI  - Detection of RNA-DNA binding sites in long noncoding RNAs.
PG  - e32
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkz037 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can act as scaffolds that promote the interaction of 
      proteins, RNA, and DNA. There is increasing evidence of sequence-specific 
      interactions of lncRNAs with DNA via triple-helix (triplex) formation. This process 
      allows lncRNAs to recruit protein complexes to specific genomic regions and regulate 
      gene expression. Here we propose a computational method called Triplex Domain Finder 
      (TDF) to detect triplexes and characterize DNA-binding domains and DNA targets 
      statistically. Case studies showed that this approach can detect the known domains 
      of lncRNAs Fendrr, HOTAIR and MEG3. Moreover, we validated a novel DNA-binding 
      domain in MEG3 by a genome-wide sequencing method. We used TDF to perform a 
      systematic analysis of the triplex-forming potential of lncRNAs relevant to human 
      cardiac differentiation. We demonstrated that the lncRNA with the highest 
      triplex-forming potential, GATA6-AS, forms triple helices in the promoter of genes 
      relevant to cardiac development. Moreover, down-regulation of GATA6-AS impairs GATA6 
      expression and cardiac development. These data indicate the unique ability of our 
      computational tool to identify novel triplex-forming lncRNAs and their target genes.

AB  - Diverse stimuli trigger Nrf2 signaling, which in turn transcriptionally regulates an 
      array of downstream targets, providing for multiple layers of control. While Nrf2 
      activity largely is governed by posttranslational modification of critical thiol 
      residues in the protein partner and redox sensor Keap1, fine-tuning is provided by 
      additional mechanisms - including epigenetic regulation. Herein, we review the 
      emerging significance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) as downstream targets and 
      upstream regulators of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Among the ~16000 lncRNAs in 
      GENCODE, some have been validated as transcriptionally regulated by Nrf2 (e.g., 
      LUCAT1, NMRAL2P, ODRUL, ROR and TUG1), and others have been identified as upstream 
      regulators of Nrf2 expression (e.g., HOTAIR, MALAT1, MEG1, NRAL and UCA1). 
      Bioinformatic analyses of annotated human lncRNAs identified putative Nrf2 binding 
      sites in the promoter regions of 13,285 lncRNAs. Further investigation is warranted 
      to validate the many novel lncRNAs as bona fide Nrf2-regulated targets, and their 
      roles in Nrf2 signaling. Nrf2 is considered a promising therapeutic candidate for 
      cancer and other chronic diseases; thus, targeting the associated lncRNAs might 
      provide for a more refined fine-tuning of the system, depending on cellular and 
      pathophysiological context.

TI  - Transfer of Extracellular Vesicle-Associated-RNAs Induces Drug Resistance in 
      ALK-Translocated Lung Adenocarcinoma.
LID - 10.3390/cancers11010104 [doi]
LID - 104
AB  - Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation is an actionable mutation in lung 
      adenocarcinoma. Nonetheless tumour consists of heterogeneous cell subpopulations 
      with diverse phenotypes and genotypes, and cancer cells can actively release 
      extracellular vesicles (EVs) to modulate the phenotype of other cells in the tumour 
      microenvironment. We hypothesized that EVs derived from a drug-resistant 
      subpopulation of cells could induce drug resistance in recipient cells. We have 
      established ALK-translocated lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and subclones. The 
      subclones have been characterized and the expression of EV-RNAs determined by 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effects of EV transfer on drug 
      resistance were examined in vitro. Serum EV-RNA was assayed serially in two patients 
      prescribed ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ALK-TKI) treatment. We demonstrated that 
      the EVs from an ALK-TKI-resistant subclone could induce drug resistance in the 
      originally sensitive subclone. EV-RNA profiling revealed that miRNAs miR-21-5p and 
      miR-486-3p, and lncRNAs MEG3 and XIST were differentially expressed in the EVs 
      secreted by the resistant subclones. These circulating EV-RNA levels have been found 
      to correlate with disease progression of EML4-ALK-translocated lung adenocarcinoma 
      in patients prescribed ALK-TKI treatment. The results from this study suggest that 
      EVs released by a drug-resistant subpopulation can induce drug resistance in other 
      subpopulations and may sustain intratumoural heterogeneity.

TI  - Plasma lncRNA expression profile as a prognostic tool in BRAF-mutant metastatic 
      melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitor.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are dysregulated in many cancer types. Abnormal 
      baseline levels of these lncRNAs display diagnostic and prognostic potential in 
      cancer patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of 
      plasma lncRNAs in BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma patients treated with a BRAF 
      inhibitor. Total RNA was isolated from plasma samples collected from 58 advanced 
      BRAF-mutant melanoma patients and 15 healthy donors. The expression levels of 90 
      lncRNAs were estimated using the LncProfiler qPCR Array Kit (SBI) and LightCycler 96 
      (Roche). LncRNA expression levels correlated with responses to the BRAF inhibitor 
      (vemurafenib) treatment. The patients were stratified into three groups based on 
      their lncRNA levels with various lncRNA expressions (low, medium, and high). A Cox 
      proportional hazards regression model was used to determine the lncRNAs that were 
      significantly associated with both progression-free and overall survivals (PFS and 
      OS, respectively) in patients receiving vemurafenib. The expression level of 12 
      lncRNAs was down-regulated, while five lncRNAs were up-regulated in melanoma 
      patients compared to healthy donors. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that upregulation 
      or downregulation of 11 and 16 different lncRNAs were associated with longer median 
      PFS and OS, respectively. Further analysis demonstrated that the baseline lncRNAs 
      for IGF2AS, anti-Peg11, MEG3, Zeb2NAT are independent prognostic factors in 
      BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib. Evaluation of 
      plasma lncRNAs expression level for advanced melanoma diagnosis and prognosis 
      evaluation appears to be a safe and valuable method; however, this method requires 
      further validation in larger cohorts and randomized trials.

AB  - In contrast to cytoplasmic localization of spliced mRNAs, many spliced lncRNAs are 
      localized in the nucleus. To investigate the mechanism, we used lncRNA MEG3 as a 
      reporter and mapped a potent nuclear retention element (NRE), deletion of this 
      element led to striking export of MEG3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Insertion 
      of the NRE resulted in nuclear retention of spliced lncRNA as well as spliced mRNA. 
      We further purified RNP assembled on the NRE in vitro and identified the proteins by 
      mass spectrometry. Screen using siRNA revealed depletion of U1 snRNP components 
      SNRPA, SNRNP70 or SNRPD2 caused significant cytoplasmic localization of MEG3 
      reporter transcripts. Co-knockdown these factors in HFF1 cells resulted in an 
      increased cytoplasmic distribution of endogenous lncRNAs. Together, these data 
      support a model that U1 snRNP components restrain spliced lncRNAs in the nucleus via 
      the interaction with nuclear retention element.

TI  - Ruguo key genes and tumor driving factors identification of bladder cancer based on 
      the RNA-seq profile.
PG  - 2717-23
LID - 10.2147/OTT.S92529 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to select several signature genes associated with bladder 
      cancer, thus to investigate the possible mechanism in bladder cancer. METHODS: The 
      mRNA expression profile data of GSE31614, including ten bladder tissues and ten 
      control samples, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. The differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) in bladder cancer samples compared with the control samples 
      were screened using the Student's t-test method. Functional analysis for the DEGs 
      was analyzed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated 
      Discovery from the Gene Ontology database, followed by the transcription function 
      annotation of DEGs from Tumor-Associated Gene database. Motifs of genes that had 
      transcription functions in promoter region were analyzed using the Seqpos. RESULTS: 
      A total of 1,571 upregulated and 1,507 downregulated DEGs in the bladder cancer 
      samples were screened. ELF3 and MYBL2 involved in cell cycle and DNA replication 
      were tumor suppressors. MEG3, APEX1, and EZH2 were related with the cell epigenetic 
      regulation in bladder cancer. Moreover, HOXB9 and EN1 that have their own motif were 
      the transcription factors. CONCLUSION: Our study has identified several key genes 
      involved in bladder cancer. ELF3 and MYBL2 are tumor suppressers, HOXB9 and EN1 are 
      the main regulators, while MEG3, APEX1, and EZH2 are driving factors for bladder 
      cancer progression.

TI  - Integrated analysis of co-expression and ceRNA network identifies five lncRNAs as 
      prognostic markers for breast cancer.
PG  - 8410-8419
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.14721 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which competitively bind miRNAs to regulate target 
      mRNA expression in the competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) network, have attracted 
      increasing attention in breast cancer research. We aim to find more effective 
      therapeutic targets and prognostic markers for breast cancer. LncRNA, mRNA and miRNA 
      expression profiles of breast cancer were downloaded from TCGA database. We screened 
      the top 5000 lncRNAs, top 5000 mRNAs and all miRNAs to perform weighted gene 
      co-expression network analysis. The correlation between modules and clinical 
      information of breast cancer was identified by Pearson's correlation coefficient. 
      Based on the most relevant modules, we constructed a ceRNA network of breast cancer. 
      Additionally, the standard Kaplan-Meier univariate curve analysis was adopted to 
      identify the prognosis of lncRNAs. Ultimately, a total of 23 and 5 modules were 
      generated in the lncRNAs/mRNAs and miRNAs co-expression network, respectively. 
      According to the Green module of lncRNAs/mRNAs and Blue module of miRNAs, our 
      constructed ceRNA network consisted of 52 lncRNAs, 17miRNAs and 79 mRNAs. Through 
      survival analysis, 5 lncRNAs (AL117190.1, COL4A2-AS1, LINC00184, MEG3 and MIR22HG) 
      were identified as crucial prognostic factors for patients with breast cancer. Taken 
      together, we have identified five novel lncRNAs related to prognosis of breast 
      cancer. Our study has contributed to the deeper understanding of the molecular 
      mechanism of breast cancer and provided novel insights into the use of breast cancer 
      drugs and prognosis.

TI  - Differential expression and prognostic value of long non-coding RNA in HPV-negative 
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 1555-1564
LID - 10.1002/hed.25136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has emerged as a new avenue of interest due 
      to its various biological functions in cancer. Abnormal expression of lncRNA has 
      been reported in other malignancies but has been understudied in head and neck 
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: The lncRNA expression was interrogated via 
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) array for 19 human 
      papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCC tumor-normal pairs. The Cancer Genome Atlas 
      (TCGA) was used to validate these results. The association between differentially 
      expressed lncRNA and survival outcomes was analyzed. RESULTS: Differential 
      expression was validated for 5 lncRNA (SPRY4-IT1, HEIH, LUCAT1, LINC00152, and 
      HAND2-AS1). There was also an inverse association between MEG3 expression (not 
      significantly differentially expressed in TCGA tumors but highly variable 
      expression) and 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS). CONCLUSION: We identified and 
      validated differential expression of 5 lncRNA in HPV-negative HNSCC. Low MEG3 
      expression was associated with favorable 3-year RFS, although the significance of 
      this finding remains unclear.

AB  - Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) has been 
      demonstrated as an important regulator in diverse human cancers. However, its 
      function and regulatory mechanism in ischemic stroke remains largely unknown. Here, 
      we report that MEG3 is physically associated with microRNA-21 (miR-21), while miR-21 
      is downregulated following ischemia in the ischemic core in vitro and in vivo, which 
      is opposite to MEG3. Besides, overexpression of miR-21 protects oxygen-glucose 
      deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, 
      MEG3 functions as a competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) and competes with programmed 
      cell death 4 (PDCD4) mRNA for directly binding to miR-21, which mediates ischemic 
      neuronal death. Knockdown of MEG3 protects against ischemic damage and improves 
      overall neurological functions in vivo. Thus, our data uncovers a novel mechanism of 
      lncRNA MEG3 as a ceRNA by targeting miR-21/PDCD4 signaling pathway in regulating 
      ischemic neuronal death, which may help develop new strategies for the therapeutic 
      interventions in cerebral ischemic stroke.

TI  - Deregulation of the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 locus ncRNAs is associated with replicative 
      senescence of human adipose-derived stem cells.
PG  - e0206534

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human adult adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) have become the most 
      promising cell source for regenerative medicine. However the prolonged ex vivo 
      expansion periods required to obtain the necessary therapeutic dose promotes 
      progressive senescence, with the concomitant reduction of their therapeutic 
      potential. AIM AND SCOPE: A better understanding of the determinants of hADSC 
      senescence is needed to improve biosafety while preserving therapeutic efficiency. 
      Here, we investigated the association between deregulation of the imprinted 
      DLK1-DIO3 region and replicative senescence in hADSC cultures. METHODS: We compared 
      hADSC cultures at short (PS) and prolonged (PL) passages, both in standard and low 
      [O2] (21 and 3%, respectively), in relation to replicative senescence. hADSCs were 
      evaluated for expression alterations in the DLK1-DIO3 region on chromosome 14q32, 
      and particularly in its main miRNA cluster. RESULTS: Comparison of hADSCs cultured 
      at PL or PS surprisingly showed a quite significant fraction (69%) of upregulated 
      miRNAs in PL cultures mapping to the imprinted 14q32 locus, the largest miRNA 
      cluster described in the genome. In agreement, expression of the lncRNA MEG3 
      (Maternally Expressed 3; Meg3/Gtl2), cultured at 21 and 3% [O2], was also 
      significantly higher in PL than in PS passages. During hADSC replicative senescence 
      the AcK16H4 activating mark was found to be significantly associated with the 
      deregulation of the entire DLK1-DIO3 locus, with a secondary regulatory role for the 
      methylation of DMR regions. CONCLUSION: A direct relationship between DLK1-DIO3 
      deregulation and replicative senescence of hADSCs is reported, involving 
      upregulation of a very significant fraction of its largest miRNA cluster (14q32.31), 
      paralleled by the progressive overexpression of the lncRNA MEG3, which plays a 
      central role in the regulation of Dlk1/Dio3 activation status in mice.

TI  - Identification of miR-379/miR-656 (C14MC) cluster downregulation and associated 
      epigenetic and transcription regulatory mechanism in oligodendrogliomas.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although role of individual microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of 
      gliomas has been well studied, their role as a clustered remains unexplored in 
      gliomas. METHODS: In this study, we performed the expression analysis of 
      miR-379/miR-656 miRNA-cluster (C14MC) in oligodendrogliomas (ODGs) and also 
      investigated the mechanism underlying modulation of this cluster. RESULTS: We 
      identified significant downregulation of majority of the miRNAs from this cluster in 
      ODGs. Further data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) also confirmed the global 
      downregulation of C14MC. Furthermore, we observed that its regulation is maintained 
      by transcription factor MEF2. In addition, epigenetic machinery involving DNA and 
      histone-methylation are also involved in its regulation, which is acting 
      independently or in synergy. The post- transcriptionally regulatory network of this 
      cluster showed enrichment of key cancer-related biological processes such as cell 
      adhesion and migration. Also, there was enrichment of several cancer related 
      pathways viz PIK3 signaling pathway and glioma pathways. Survival analysis 
      demonstrated association of C14MC (miR-487b and miR-409-3p) with poor progression 
      free survival in ODGs. CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrates tumor-suppressive role of 
      C14MC and its role in pathogenesis of ODGs and therefore could be relevant for the 
      development of new therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Wilms' tumor (WT) is the most common type of childhood kidney cancer, and most cases 
      present with favorable histology and respond well to standard treatment. However, a 
      subset of patients with WT is diagnosed with bilateral, relapsed, and high-risk 
      tumors which remain the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Long 
      noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their aberrant expression have currently been 
      attracting great attention as oncogenes or tumor suppressors during tumor initiation 
      and progression. So far, their roles and related competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) 
      network remain unelucidated in nephroblastoma pathogenesis. We comprehensively 
      integrated lncRNA, microRNA (miRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles 
      from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatment 
      (TARGET) database and screened out differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs), lncRNAs 
      (DELs), and miRNAs (DEMis) to construct a ceRNA network based on the information 
      generated from miRcode, miRTarBase, TargetScan, and miRDB. Gene ontology (GO) and 
      Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were 
      performed to analyze the functional characteristics of DEMs in the ceRNA network. 
      The interaction between protein molecules was also analyzed by establishing a 
      protein-protein interaction network. Finally, prognosis-related biomarkers were 
      identified via survival analysis. Initially, 1647 DELs, 115 DEMis, and 3280 DEMs 
      (|log FC| > 2; FDR < 0.01) were obtained using the R package. Next, we constructed a 
      lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network (ceRNA network), in which 176 DELs, 24 DEMis, and 141 DEMs 
      were identified. Furthermore, 148 functional enrichment terms from GO were 
      identified and 29 KEGG pathways were found to be significantly enriched. We also 
      integrated patient clinical information to analyze the association between DERNAs 
      and patient prognosis. We found that high expression of 8 DELs (LINC00473, 
      AL445228.2, DENND5B-AS1, DLEU2, AC123595.1, AC135178.1, LINC00535, and LMO7-AS1) and 
      4 DEMs (CEP55, DEPDC1, PHF19, and TRIM36) correlated with poor survival in a patient 
      with WT, whereas high expression of 2 DELs (MEG3 and RMST), 1 DEM (KIAA0922), and 1 
      DEMi (hsa-mir-200a) could possibly lead to better clinical outcomes. For the first 
      time, the present study provided a novel insight into lncRNA-related ceRNA networks 
      and identified potential prognostic biomarkers in Wilms' tumor.

AB  - Bisphosphonates (BPs) are inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption used for 
      the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) patients with osteolytic lesions. 
      Bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw (BONJ) is an infrequent drug-caused 
      adverse event of these agents. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a set of more than 
      200 base pairs, noncoding RNA molecules, which are critical posttranscriptional 
      regulators of gene expression. Our study was aimed at evaluating 17 lncRNAs, whose 
      targets were previously validated as key elements in MM, bone metabolism, and 
      angiogenesis in MM subjects without BONJ (MM group), in MM subjects with BONJ (BONJ 
      group), and a group of healthy controls (CTRL group). Our results demonstrated a 
      different lncRNA profile in BONJ patients compared to MM patients and controls. Two 
      lncRNAs (DANCR and MALAT1) were both downregulated compared to controls and MM, 
      twelve (HOTAIR, MEG3, TP73-AS1, HOTTIP, HIF1A-AS2, MANTIS, CTD-2201E18, CTD1-2003C8, 
      R-471B22, RP1-43E13, RP11-553L6.5, and RP1-286D6) were overexpressed in MM with 
      BONJ, and one (H19) was upregulated compared with only MM. Two lncRNAs (JHDMD1 and 
      MTMR9LP) had higher expression, but these differences were not statistically 
      significant. The examined lncRNAs target several genes and metabolic pathways. An 
      altered lncRNA signature could contribute to the onset of BONJ or have a protective 
      action. Targeting these lncRNAs could offer a possibility for the prevention or 
      therapy of BONJ.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the differential expression and 
      functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in neuroblastoma tissue. LncRNA 
      microarrays were used to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs between tumor and 
      para-tumor tissues. In total, in tumor tissues, 3,098 and 1,704 lncRNAs were 
      upregulated and downregulated, respectively. HCN3 and linc01105 exhibited the higher 
      expression (P < 0.05; P < 0.01, respectively) in neuroblastoma tissue, whereas MEG3 
      displayed the lower expression (P < 0.01). HIF-1α expression was negatively 
      correlated with cell proliferation in the linc01105 KD group. In addition, Noxa and 
      Bid expression was positively correlated with cell apoptosis. Moreover, linc01105 
      knockdown promoted cell proliferation, whereas MEG3 overexpression inhibited 
      proliferation. Finally, linc01105 knockdown, MEG3 overexpression and HCN3 knockdown 
      all increased apoptosis. The correlation coefficients between those three lncRNAs 
      and the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) stage were -0.48, -0.58 
      and -0.55, respectively. In conclusion, we have identified lncRNAs that are 
      differentially expressed in neuroblastoma tissues. The lncRNAs HCN3, linc01105, and 
      MEG3 may be important in biological behaviors of neuroblastoma through mechanisms 
      involving p53 pathway members such as HIF-1α, Noxa, and Bid. The expressions of 
      MEG3, HCN3 and linc01105 are all negatively correlated with the INSS stage.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). ceRNA 
      networks may serve important roles in various tumors, as demonstrated by an 
      increasing number of studies; however, papillary renal cell carcinoma 
      (PRCC)‑associated ceRNA networks mediated by lncRNAs remain unknown. Increased 
      knowledge of ceRNA networks in PRCC may aid the identification of novel targets and 
      biomarkers in the treatment of PRCC. In the present study, a comprehensive 
      investigation of mRNA, lncRNA, and microRNA (miRNA) expression in PRCC was conducted 
      using sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Differential expression (DE) 
      profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs were evaluated, with 1,970 mRNAs, 
      1,201 lncRNAs and 96 miRNAs identified as genes with significantly different 
      expression between PRCC and control paracancerous tissues. Based on the identified 
      DEmRNAs, a protein‑protein interaction network was generated using the STRING 
      database. Furthermore, a ceRNA network for PRCC was determined using a targeted 
      assay combined with the DE of miRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs, enabling the identification 
      of important lncRNA‑miRNA and miRNA‑mRNA pairs. Analysis of the ceRNA network led to 
      the extraction of a subnetwork and the identification of lncRNA maternally 
      expressed 3 (MEG3), lncRNA PWRN1, miRNA (miR)‑508, miR‑21 and miR519 as important 
      genes. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was 
      conducted to validate the results of the bioinformatics analyses; it was revealed 
      that lncRNA MEG3 expression levels were downregulated in PRCC tumor tissues compared 
      with adjacent non‑tumor tissues. In addition, survival analysis was conducted to 
      investigate the association between identified genes and the prognosis of patients 
      with PRCC, indicating the potential involvement of 13 mRNAs, 15 lncRNAs and six 
      miRNAs. In conclusion, the present study may improve understanding of the regulatory 
      mechanisms of ceRNA networks in PRCC and provide novel insight for future studies of 
      prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.

TI  - Upregulation of lncRNA MEG3 Promotes Osteogenic Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem 
      Cells From Multiple Myeloma Patients By Targeting BMP4 Transcription.
PG  - 1985-97
LID - 10.1002/stem.1989 [doi]
AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the impaired osteogenic differentiation of 
      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are 
      still poorly understood. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important 
      regulatory molecules in tumor-suppressor and oncogenic pathways. Here we showed that 
      MSCs from MM expressed less lncRNA MEG3 relative to those from normal donors during 
      osteogenic differentiation. To evaluate the effect of MEG3 on osteogenesis, bone 
      marrow MSCs with enhanced or reduced MEG3 were prepared. We observed that MEG3 
      knockdown significantly reduced the expression of key osteogenic markers, including 
      Runt-related transcription factor 2, osterix, and osteocalcin, while overexpression 
      of MEG3 enhanced their expression. Additionally, MEG3 knockdown decreased BMP4 
      transcription. Here we showed that MEG3 was critical for SOX2 transcriptional 
      repression of the BMP4. MEG3, which is located near the BMP4 gene, could dissociate 
      the transcription factor SOX2 from the BMP4 promoter. A stable complex containing 
      the MEG3, SOX2, and the SOX2 consensus site of BMP4 suggested that MEG3 activated 
      transcriptional activity by directly influencing SOX2 activity. By using assays such 
      as luciferase, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and RNA immunoprecipitation, we showed 
      that MEG3 had a critical function in a mechanism of promoter-specific 
      transcriptional activation. These results suggested that MEG3 played an essential 
      role in osteogenic differentiation in bone marrow MSCs, partly by activating BMP4 
      transcription. Our data provided novel evidence for the biological and clinical 
      significance of lncRNA MEG3 expression as a potential biomarker for identifying 
      patients with MM and as a potential therapeutic target in MM.

TI  - Association between PEG3 DNA methylation and high-grade cervical intraepithelial

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epigenetic mechanisms are hypothesized to contribute substantially to 
      the progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to cervical cancer, 
      although empirical data are limited. METHODS: Women (n = 419) were enrolled at 
      colposcopic evaluation at Duke Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. Human 
      papillomavirus (HPV) was genotyped by HPV linear array and CIN grade was ascertained 
      by biopsy pathologic review. DNA methylation was measured at differentially 
      methylated regions (DMRs) regulating genomic imprinting of the IGF2/H19, IGF2AS, 
      MESTIT1/MEST, MEG3, PLAGL1/HYMAI, KvDMR and PEG10, PEG3 imprinted domains, using 
      Sequenom-EpiTYPER assays. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the 
      associations between HPV infection, DMR methylation and CIN risk overall and by 
      race. RESULTS: Of the 419 participants, 20 had CIN3+, 52 had CIN2, and 347 had ≤ 
      CIN1 (CIN1 and negative histology). The median participant age was 28.6 (IQR:11.6) 
      and 40% were African American. Overall, we found no statistically significant 
      association between altered methylation in selected DMRs and CIN2+ compared to 
      ≤CIN1. Similarly, there was no significant association between DMR methylation and 
      CIN3+ compared to ≤CIN2. Restricting the outcome to CIN2+ cases that were HR-HPV 
      positive and p16 staining positive, we found a significant association with PEG3 DMR 
      methylation (OR: 1.56 95% CI: 1.03-2.36). CONCLUSIONS: While the small number of 
      high-grade CIN cases limit inferences, our findings suggest an association between 
      altered DNA methylation at regulatory regions of PEG3 and high grade CIN in 
      high-risk HPV positive cases.

TI  - Expression Levels of Long Non-Coding RNAs Change in Models of Altered Muscle 
      Activity and Muscle Mass.

AB  - Skeletal muscle is a highly plastic organ that is necessary for homeostasis and 
      health of the human body. The size of skeletal muscle changes in response to 
      intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli. Although protein-coding RNAs including myostatin, 
      NF-κβ, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), have pivotal roles in determining 
      the skeletal muscle mass, the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the 
      regulation of skeletal muscle mass remains to be elucidated. Here, we performed 
      expression profiling of nine skeletal muscle differentiation-related lncRNAs (DRR, 
      DUM1, linc-MD1, linc-YY1, LncMyod, Neat1, Myoparr, Malat1, and SRA) and three 
      genomic imprinting-related lncRNAs (Gtl2, H19, and IG-DMR) in mouse skeletal muscle. 
      The expression levels of these lncRNAs were examined by quantitative RT-PCR in six 
      skeletal muscle atrophy models (denervation, casting, tail suspension, 
      dexamethasone-administration, cancer cachexia, and fasting) and two skeletal muscle 
      hypertrophy models (mechanical overload and deficiency of the myostatin gene). 
      Cluster analyses of these lncRNA expression levels were successfully used to 
      categorize the muscle atrophy models into two sub-groups. In addition, the 
      expression of Gtl2, IG-DMR, and DUM1 was altered along with changes in the skeletal 
      muscle size. The overview of the expression levels of lncRNAs in multiple muscle 
      atrophy and hypertrophy models provides a novel insight into the role of lncRNAs in 
      determining the skeletal muscle mass.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression by association with 
      chromatin, but how they target chromatin remains poorly understood. We have used 
      chromatin RNA immunoprecipitation-coupled high-throughput sequencing to identify 276 
      lncRNAs enriched in repressive chromatin from breast cancer cells. Using one of the 
      chromatin-interacting lncRNAs, MEG3, we explore the mechanisms by which lncRNAs 
      target chromatin. Here we show that MEG3 and EZH2 share common target genes, 
      including the TGF-β pathway genes. Genome-wide mapping of MEG3 binding sites reveals 
      that MEG3 modulates the activity of TGF-β genes by binding to distal regulatory 
      elements. MEG3 binding sites have GA-rich sequences, which guide MEG3 to the 
      chromatin through RNA-DNA triplex formation. We have found that RNA-DNA triplex 
      structures are widespread and are present over the MEG3 binding sites associated 
      with the TGF-β pathway genes. Our findings suggest that RNA-DNA triplex formation 
      could be a general characteristic of target gene recognition by the 
      chromatin-interacting lncRNAs.

TI  - Obesity-related DNA methylation at imprinted genes in human sperm: Results from the 
      TIEGER study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epigenetic reprogramming in mammalian gametes resets methylation marks 
      that regulate monoallelic expression of imprinted genes. In males, this involves 
      erasure of the maternal methylation marks and establishment of paternal-specific 
      methylation to appropriately guide normal development. The degree to which exogenous 
      factors influence the fidelity of methylation reprogramming is unknown. We 
      previously found an association between paternal obesity and altered DNA methylation 
      in umbilical cord blood, suggesting that the father's endocrine, nutritional, or 
      lifestyle status could potentiate intergenerational heritable epigenetic 
      abnormalities. In these analyses, we examine the relationship between male 
      overweight/obesity and DNA methylation status of imprinted gene regulatory regions 
      in the gametes. METHODS: Linear regression models were used to compare sperm DNA 
      methylation percentages, quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing, at 12 
      differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from 23 overweight/obese and 44 normal 
      weight men. Our study population included 69 volunteers from The Influence of the 
      Environment on Gametic Epigenetic Reprogramming (TIEGER) study, based in NC, USA. 
      RESULTS: After adjusting for age and fertility patient status, semen from overweight 
      or obese men had significantly lower methylation percentages at the MEG3 (β = -1.99; 
      SE = 0.84; p = 0.02), NDN (β = -1.10; SE = 0.47; p = 0.02), SNRPN (β = -0.65; 
      SE = 0.27; p = 0.02), and SGCE/PEG10 (β = -2.5; SE = 1.01; p = 0.01) DMRs. Our data 
      further suggest a slight increase in DNA methylation at the MEG3-IG DMR (β = +1.22; 
      SE = 0.59; p = 0.04) and H19 DMR (β = +1.37; SE = 0.62; p = 0.03) in sperm of 
      overweight/obese men. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that male overweight/obesity 
      status is traceable in the sperm epigenome. Further research is needed to understand 
      the effect of such changes and the point of origin of DNA methylation differences 
      between lean and overweight/obese men. Together with our earlier reports on paternal 
      obesity and epigenetic shifts in the offspring, our studies set the groundwork for 
      future studies investigating male gametic methylation aberrations due to paternal 
      lifestyle factors such as obesity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Long noncoding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) nowadays emerge as important 
      biomarkers or potential therapeutic targets discussed in human cancers. Among them, 
      maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is known to be decreased in a variety of 
      malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase 
      chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression of MEG3 in forty 
      pairs of lung cancer (LC) tissues. Overexpression of MEG3 was carried out, and we 
      determined its effect on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration evaluated by 
      cell counting kit-8, flow cytometric, and transwell analysis. Messenger RNA and 
      protein expression of MYC were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. 
      RESULTS: The expression of MEG3 was downregulated in LC tissues. Forced expression 
      of MEG3 led to reduced abilities of cell proliferation and elevated apoptosis rate. 
      It also slightly inhibited cell migration capacity in vitro. In addition, MYC was 
      inhibited by MEG3 overexpression at both transcriptional and translational levels. 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed MEG3 could regulate LC progression and serve as an 
      important target for LC treatment.

TI  - Acupuncture regulates the autophagy of ovarian granulosa cells in polycystic ovarian 
      syndrome ovulation disorder by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway through LncMEG3.

AB  - The main features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are abnormal follicular 
      development and ovulation dysfunction, which are caused by the excessive autophagy 
      of ovarian granulosa cells. Acupuncture has been shown to improve ovulation 
      dysfunction and abnormal follicular development in PCOS patients, but its mechanism 
      is unclear. This study hypothesized that the beneficial effects of acupuncture are 
      the result of LncMEG3-mediated effects on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Acupuncture 
      (CV-4, RN-3, CV-6, SP-6 and EX-CA 1) was used to treat a rat model of polycystic 
      ovary syndrome. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe ovarian morphology 
      and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and 
      real-time PCR were used to detect LH, E2, FSH, T, AMH, LncMEG3, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, P62 
      and LC3II/I expression. The ovarian morphology of 90% of the rats in the acupuncture 
      treatment group was significantly improved after 11 consecutive days of therapy. 
      Acupuncture also resulted in a significant decrease in serum LH, FSH, T and AMH 
      levels and a significant increase in E2 level (P<0.01). LncMEG3, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, 
      P62 and LC3II/I expression was decreased in ovarian granulosa cells after 
      acupuncture compared with PCOS and lentiviral Intervention Group (P<0.05), while the 
      expression of follicle stimulating hormone receptor was increased (P<0.05). These 
      results indicate that acupuncture can down-regulate the expression of LncMEG3 and 
      thereby inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, reducing granulosa cell autophagy and 
      normalizing their proliferation. These factors ultimately remedy abnormal follicular 
      development. These findings suggest that acupuncture has clinical potential as a 
      safe treatment for PCOS ovulatory dysfunction.

AB  - Pituitary adenomas (PA) is one of the most frequent types of intracranial neoplasms. 
      Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) played important roles in the progression of human 
      cancers, including PA. However, the roles of lncRNAs in PA remained to be further 
      investigated. We performed analysis of GSE26966 dataset to identify differently 
      expressed lncRNAs in PA. Co-expression network, lncRNA-RNA binding proteins network, 
      and competing endogenous RNA networks were constructed. Moreover, we performed 
      RT-qPCR assay to validate four key lncRNAs expression in PA. This study identified 
      differently expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs by using GSE26966 database. Furthermore, we 
      constructed lncRNA-mRNA co-expression, lncRNA-RBP interaction and ceRNA networks. 
      Bioinformatics analysis showed these lncRNAs were involved in regulating mechanical 
      stimulus, gene expression, JAK-STAT cascade, cell cycle arrest, FoxO signaling, 
      HIF-1 signaling, Insulin signaling, Oxytocin signaling, and MAPK signaling. We also 
      showed KCNQ1OT1, SNHG7, MEG3, and SNHG5 were down-regulated in PA. Our findings 
      could provide a novel insight to understand the mechanisms of lncRNAs underlying PA 
      pathogenesis and identify new biomarkers for PA.

LID - 10.7554/eLife.60833 [doi]
LID - e60833
AB  - We describe MIP-1 and MIP-2, novel paralogous C. elegans germ granule components 
      that interact with the intrinsically disordered MEG-3 protein. These proteins 
      promote P granule condensation, form granules independently of MEG-3 in the 
      postembryonic germ line, and balance each other in regulating P granule growth and 
      localization. MIP-1 and MIP-2 each contain two LOTUS domains and intrinsically 
      disordered regions and form homo- and heterodimers. They bind and anchor the Vasa 
      homolog GLH-1 within P granules and are jointly required for coalescence of MEG-3, 
      GLH-1, and PGL proteins. Animals lacking MIP-1 and MIP-2 show temperature-sensitive 
      embryonic lethality, sterility, and mortal germ lines. Germline phenotypes include 
      defects in stem cell self-renewal, meiotic progression, and gamete differentiation. 
      We propose that these proteins serve as scaffolds and organizing centers for 
      ribonucleoprotein networks within P granules that help recruit and balance essential 
      RNA processing machinery to regulate key developmental transitions in the germ line.

TI  - [Relationships between microRNA expressions and prognosis in patients with tongue 
      squamous cell carcinoma and the mechanisms microRNA regulating tongue squamous cell 
      carcinoma biological behavior].
PG  - 5-9
AB  - Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is the most common type of oral cancer and is 
      well known for its high rate of proliferation and lymph nodal metastasis. Exploring 
      the underlying pathways regulating TSCC could provide novel ideas for diagnosis and 
      prognosis of TSCC patients, as well as molecular targets for treatment of TSCC. 
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that inhibit gene expression through the 
      3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of their target messenger RNAs. They play crucial 
      roles in numerous biological processes, including cancer progression. Although great 
      efforts have been made, what role miRNAs may play in the early detection and 
      diagnosis of TSCC is not fully understood. Recently, our team has performed a series 
      of basic and clinical researches in an attempt to investigate the relationships 
      between miRNA expressions and prognosis of patients with TSCC and the mechanisms 
      under regulation of TSCC. The results showed that miR-195, miR-34a, miR-29b, miR-375 
      and miR-26a could inhibit TSCC cells progression and development via a sophisticated 
      network of genes. Specifically, the anti-tumor effects of miR-195 in TSCC may be 
      partially mediated by its inhibition of CyclinD1 and Bcl-2 expression. The 
      expression of miR-34a could inhibit migration and invasion of TSCC cell lines via 
      targeting MMP9 and MMP14. The function of miR-29b may be through the 
      miR-29b/Sp1/PTEN/AKT axis. Overexpression of miR-375 inhibited Sp1 expression by 
      targeting the 3' untranslated region of the Sp1 transcript. MEG3 and miR-26a 
      inhibited TSCC cell proliferation, cycle progression and promoted cell apoptosis and 
      miR-26a could increase the MEG3 expression through reduction of the expression of 
      DNMT3B in TSCC. In light of the role of those miRNAs in diagnosis and prognosis of 
      TSCC, we reported that decreased miR-195 and miR-375 expression was associated with 
      poor overall survival rate of the TSCC patients, while miR-34a expression was 
      negatively correlated with cervical lymph node metastases. Furthermore, combined low 
      expression levels of miR-26a and MEG3 emerged as an independent prognostic factor 
      for poor clinical outcomes in TSCC patients, suggesting that combined miR-26a and 
      MEG3 expression might prove useful as an independent biomarker of clinical prognosis 
      among TSCC patients.

TI  - Caspase recruitment domain family member 9 expression is a promising biomarker in 
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

AB  - AIM: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a refractory digestive organ 
      cancer that requires better treatment strategies. We have recently reported that the 
      antidiabetic drug metformin exerts antitumor effects on ESCC by inhibition of 
      nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) nuclear translocation. In the present study, we 
      focused on caspase recruitment domain family member 9 (CARD9), an essential signal 
      adapter in NF-κB activation to examine whether it can be used as a prognostic factor 
      in ESCC. METHODS: We investigated CARD9 expression immunohistochemically in clinical 
      samples obtained from 93 patients with ESCC who underwent curative esophagectomy. 
      CARD9 expression was analyzed for correlation with clinicopathological 
      characteristics and ESCC prognosis. The molecular effects were investigated by 
      knocking down ESCC cells. Comprehensive RNA expression changes in these ESCC cells 
      were detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS). RESULTS: High CARD9 expression is 
      significantly correlated with advanced tumor depth (P < .001), positive lymph node 
      metastasis (P = .005) and advanced stage (P = .001). Kaplan-Meier method and the 
      log-rank test showed that overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 
      significantly poor in the high CARD9 expression group (OS: P = .027, DFS: P = .005). 
      Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that high CARD9 expression is a 
      significant poor prognostic factor for DFS. Cell proliferation and migration were 
      suppressed by CARD9 knockdown. NGS detected altered the expression of some RNAs 
      including maternally expressed 3 (MEG3). CONCLUSION: High CARD9 expression is 
      significantly associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, CARD9 expression may be a 
      prospective prognostic biomarker in ESCC.

TI  - Reconstruction and analysis of the aberrant lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network based on 
      competitive endogenous RNA in CESC.
PG  - 6665-6673
LID - 10.1002/jcb.26850 [doi]
AB  - A growing body of studies has demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are 
      regarded as the primary section of the ceRNA network. This is thought to be the case 
      owing to its regulation of protein-coding gene expression by functioning as miRNA 
      sponges. However, functional roles and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated 
      ceRNA in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), as well as their use for potential 
      prediction of CESC prognosis, remains unknown. The aberrant expression profiles of 
      mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA of 306 cervical squamous cancer tissues and three adjacent 
      cervical tissues were obtained from the TCGA database. A lncRNA-mRNA-miRNA ceRNA 
      network in CESC was constructed. Meanwhile, Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway 
      analysis were performed using Cytoscape plug-in BinGo and DAVID database. We 
      identified a total of 493 lncRNA, 70 miRNA, and 1921 mRNA as differentially 
      expressed profiles. An aberrant lncRNA-mRNA-miRNA ceRNA network was constructed in 
      CESC, it was composed of 50 DElncRNA, 18 DEmiRNA, and 81 DEmRNA. According to the 
      overall survival analysis, 3 out of 50 lncRNA, 10 out of 81 mRNA, and 1 out of 18 
      miRNA functioned as prognostic biomarkers for patients with CESC (P value < 0.05). 
      We extracted the sub-network in the ceRNA network and found that two novel lncRNA 
      were recognized as key genes. These included lncRNA MEG3 and lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2. The 
      present study provides a new insight into a better understanding of the 
      lncRNA-related ceRNA network in CESC, and the novel recognized ceRNA network will 
      help us to improve our understanding of lncRNA-mediated ceRNA regulatory mechanisms 
      in the pathogenesis of CESC.

TI  - An imprinted non-coding genomic cluster at 14q32 defines clinically relevant 
      molecular subtypes in osteosarcoma across multiple independent datasets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A microRNA (miRNA) collection on the imprinted 14q32 MEG3 region has 
      been associated with outcome in osteosarcoma. We assessed the clinical utility of 
      this miRNA set and their association with methylation status. METHODS: We integrated 
      coding and non-coding RNA data from three independent annotated clinical 
      osteosarcoma cohorts (n = 65, n = 27, and n = 25) and miRNA and methylation data 
      from one in vitro (19 cell lines) and one clinical (NCI Therapeutically Applicable 
      Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) osteosarcoma dataset, n = 80) 
      dataset. We used time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (tdROC) analysis 
      to evaluate the clinical value of candidate miRNA profiles and machine learning 
      approaches to compare the coding and non-coding transcriptional programs of high- 
      and low-risk osteosarcoma tumors and high- versus low-aggressiveness cell lines. In 
      the cell line and TARGET datasets, we also studied the methylation patterns of the 
      MEG3 imprinting control region on 14q32 and their association with miRNA expression 
      and tumor aggressiveness. RESULTS: In the tdROC analysis, miRNA sets on 14q32 showed 
      strong discriminatory power for recurrence and survival in the three clinical 
      datasets. High- or low-risk tumor classification was robust to using different 
      microRNA sets or classification methods. Machine learning approaches showed that 
      genome-wide miRNA profiles and miRNA regulatory networks were quite different 
      between the two outcome groups and mRNA profiles categorized the samples in a manner 
      concordant with the miRNAs, suggesting potential molecular subtypes. Further, miRNA 
      expression patterns were reproducible in comparing high-aggressiveness versus 
      low-aggressiveness cell lines. Methylation patterns in the MEG3 differentially 
      methylated region (DMR) also distinguished high-aggressiveness from 
      low-aggressiveness cell lines and were associated with expression of several 14q32 
      miRNAs in both the cell lines and the large TARGET clinical dataset. Within the 
      limits of available CpG array coverage, we observed a potential 
      methylation-sensitive regulation of the non-coding RNA cluster by CTCF, a known 
      enhancer-blocking factor. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of imprinting/methylation changes in the 
      14q32 non-coding region defines reproducible previously unrecognized osteosarcoma 
      subtypes with distinct transcriptional programs and biologic and clinical behavior. 
      Future studies will define the precise relationship between 14q32 imprinting, 
      non-coding RNA expression, genomic enhancer binding, and tumor aggressiveness, with 
      possible therapeutic implications for both early- and advanced-stage patients.

AB  - Epigenetic processes, such as changes in DNA methylation, likely mediate the link 
      between environmental exposures in utero and altered gene expression. Differentially 
      methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate imprinted genes may be especially vulnerable 
      to environmental exposures since imprinting is established and maintained largely 
      through DNA methylation, resulting in expression from only one parental chromosome. 
      We used the human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK-293, to investigate the effects of 
      exposure to physiologically relevant doses of lead acetate (Pb) on the methylation 
      status of nine imprinted gene DMRs. We assessed mean methylation after seventy-two 
      hours of Pb exposure (0-25 μg/dL) using bisulfite pyrosequencing. The PEG1/MEST and 
      IGF2 DMRs had maximum methylation decreases of 9.6% (20 μg/dL; p<0.005) and 3.8% (25 
      μg/dL; p<0.005), respectively. Changes at the MEG3 DMRs had a maximum decrease in 
      methylation of 2.9% (MEG3) and 1.8% (MEG3-IG) at 5 μg/dL Pb, but were not 
      statistically significant. The H19, NNAT, PEG3, PLAGL1, and SGCE/PEG10 DMRs showed a 
      less than 0.5% change in methylation, across the dose range used, and were deemed 
      non-responsive to Pb in our model. Pb exposure below reportable/actionable levels 
      increased expression of PEG1/MEST concomitant with decreased methylation. These 
      results suggest that Pb exposure can stably alter the regulatory capacity of 
      multiple imprinted DMRs.

TI  - Long Noncoding RNA MEG3 Suppresses Glioma Cell Proliferation, Migration, and 
      Invasion by Acting as a Competing Endogenous RNA of miR-19a.
PG  - 1471-1478

AB  - Glioma, with varying malignancy grades and histological subtypes, is the most common 
      primary brain tumor in adults. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding 
      transcripts and have been proven to play an important role in tumorigenesis. Our 
      study aims to elucidate the combined effect of lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 
      (MEG3) and microRNA-19a (miR-19a) in human glioma U87 and U251 cell lines. Real-time 
      PCR revealed that MEG3 was downregulated and miR-19a was upregulated in malignant 
      glioma tissues and cell lines. Bioinformatics analyses (TargetScan, miRanda, and 
      starBase V2.0) showed that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a target of 
      miR-19a with complementary binding sites in the 3'-UTR. As expected, luciferase 
      results verified the putative target site and also revealed the complementary 
      binding between miR-19a and MEG3. miR-19a represses the expression of PTEN and 
      promotes glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. However, MEG3 could 
      directly bind to miR-19a and effectively act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) 
      for miR-19a to suppress tumorigenesis. Our study is the first to demonstrate that 
      lncRNA MEG3 suppresses glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by acting 
      as a ceRNA of miR-19a, which provides a novel insight about the pathogenesis of 
      glioma.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key players in gene regulation. 
      However, our incomplete understanding of the structure of lncRNAs has hindered 
      molecular characterization of their function. Maternally expressed gene 3 (Meg3) 
      lncRNA is a tumor suppressor that is downregulated in various types of cancer. 
      Mechanistic studies have reported a role for Meg3 in epigenetic regulation by 
      interacting with chromatin-modifying complexes such as the polycomb repressive 
      complex 2 (PRC2), guiding them to genomic sites via DNA-RNA triplex formation. 
      Resolving the structure of Meg3 RNA and characterizing its interactions with 
      cellular binding partners will deepen our understanding of tumorigenesis and provide 
      a framework for RNA-based anti-cancer therapies. Herein, we characterize the 
      architectural landscape of Meg3 RNA and its interactions with PRC2 from a functional 
      standpoint.

TI  - PRINS lncRNA Is a New Biomarker Candidate for HPV Infection and Prognosis of Head 
      and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics10100762 [doi]
LID - 762
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the 
      important risk factors for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) progression 
      and affects the expression of multiple genes, which might serve as new biomarkers. 
      This study examines the effects of HPV infection on long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) 
      expression and the immune system, particularly PRINS (Psoriasis 
      susceptibility-related RNA Gene Induced by Stress). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
      expression data for lncRNA genes and clinical data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 
      5/7. The expressions of PRINS, CDKN2B-AS1, TTTY14, TTTY15, MEG3, and H19 were 
      significantly different in HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients. HPV-positive 
      patients with high PRINS expression demonstrated significantly better overall 
      survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). HPV-positive patients with high PRINS 
      expression showed changes in gene expression associated with immune and antiviral 
      responses. A majority of HPV-positive patients with high PRINS expression 
      demonstrated a high number of immune cells within tumors. PRINS expression was 
      significantly associated with HPV-infection HNSCC tumors. Validation of these 
      results using data set from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) indicated that PRINS is 
      upregulated in HPV active infections and in "atypical 1 (IR)" HNSCC clusters, 
      negatively influencing patients' overall survival. Patients with high PRINS 
      expression display different immunological profiles than those with low expression 
      levels. For instance, they have active HPV infection status or are clustered in the 
      "atypical 1 (IR)" subtype of HNSCC which influences both viral infection and 
      patients' survival. It is likely that PRINS could be used as a potential biomarker 
      for HNSCC patients, but its role is dual. On the one hand, it stimulates patients' 
      immune response, while on the other it can be favorable in virus replication.

AB  - Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies are the most important pathogenic marker in 
      patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). The antibodies bind to AChRs on the 
      postsynaptic membrane, and this leads to receptor degradation, destruction, or 
      functional blocking with impaired signal at the neuromuscular junction. In this 
      study, we have explored the effects of AChR antibodies binding to mature human 
      myotubes with agrin-induced AChR clusters and pathways relevant for AChR degradation 
      using bulk RNA sequencing. Protein-coding RNAs and lncRNAs were examined by RNA 
      sequencing analysis. AChR antibodies induced marked changes of the transcriptomic 
      profiles, with over 400 genes differentially expressed. Cholesterol metabolic 
      processes and extracellular matrix organization gene sets were influenced and 
      represent AChR-trafficking related pathways. Muscle contraction and cellular 
      homeostasis gene sets were also affected, and independently of AChR trafficking. 
      Furthermore, we found changes in a protein-coding RNA and lncRNA network, where 
      expression of lncRNA MEG3 correlated closely with protein-coding genes for cellular 
      homeostasis. We conclude that AChR antibodies induce an active response in human 
      skeletal muscle cells which affects key intra- and extracellular pathways.

AB  - Imprinted genes show parent-specific activity (functional haploidy), which makes 
      them particularly vulnerable to epigenetic dysregulation. Here we studied the 
      methylation profiles of oppositely imprinted genes at single DNA molecule resolution 
      by two independent parental allele-specific deep bisulfite sequencing (DBS) 
      techniques. Using Roche (GSJunior) next generation sequencing technology, we 
      analyzed the maternally imprinted MEST promoter and the paternally imprinted MEG3 
      intergenic (IG) differentially methylated region (DMR) in fetal cord blood, adult 
      blood, and visceral adipose tissue. Epimutations were defined as paternal or 
      maternal alleles with >50% aberrantly (de)methylated CpG sites, showing the wrong 
      methylation imprint. The epimutation rates (range 2-66%) of the paternal MEST and 
      the maternal MEG3 IG DMR allele, which should be completely unmethylated, were 
      significantly higher than those (0-15%) of the maternal MEST and paternal MEG3 
      alleles, which are expected to be fully methylated. This hypermethylation of the 
      non-imprinted allele (HNA) was independent of parental origin. Very low epimutation 
      rates in sperm suggest that HNA occurred after fertilization. DBS with Illumina 
      (MiSeq) technology confirmed HNA for the MEST promoter and the MEG3 IG DMR, and to a 
      lesser extent, for the paternally imprinted secondary MEG3 promoter and the 
      maternally imprinted PEG3 promoter. HNA leads to biallelic methylation of imprinted 
      genes in a considerable proportion of normal body cells (somatic mosaicism) and is 
      highly variable between individuals. We propose that during development and 
      differentiation maintenance of differential methylation at most imprinting control 
      regions may become to some extent redundant. The accumulation of stochastic and 
      environmentally-induced methylation errors on the non-imprinted allele may increase 
      epigenetic diversity between cells and individuals.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms of lncRNA-p53 regulatory network genes are associated with 
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy toxicities and efficacy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma 
      patients.

AB  - The relevance of the transcription factor p53 in cancer is inarguable, and numerous 
      lncRNAs are involved in the p53 regulatory network as either regulators or 
      effectors, triggering a transcriptional response that causes either cell arrest or 
      apoptosis following DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. Despite the fact that the 
      therapeutic response is improved in NPC, heterogeneity among people remains with 
      regard to the susceptibility of adverse effects and the efficacy of treatments. 
      Therefore, we analysed eight potentially functional SNPs of five genes in the 
      lncRNA-p53 regulatory network in a discovery cohort of 505 NPC patients. By 
      performing multivariate logistic regression, the impact of genetic variations on the 
      efficacy and risk of CRT-induced toxicities was investigated. The most dramatic 
      finding was that the MEG3 rs10132552 CC genotype had a greater than three-fold 
      increased risk of developing grade 3-4 anaemia (OR = 3.001, 95%CI = 1.355-6.646, 
      P = 0.007). Furthermore, the rs10132552 CT genotype had a better response to 
      treatment (OR = 0.261, 95%CI = 0.089-0.770, P = 0.015). Individuals carrying 
      LINC-ROR rs2027701 with one or two variant alleles had significant associations with 
      a reduced risk of neutropaenia (OR = 0.503, 95%CI = 0.303-0.835, P = 0.008). In 
      conclusion, our results suggested that genetic polymorphisms of the lncRNA-p53 
      regulatory network could play a potential role in reducing treatment-related 
      toxicities and improving outcomes for NPC patients.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important 
      roles in tumorigenesis and progression. We aimed to identify a panel of lncRNAs for 
      the diagnosis and recurrence prediction in bladder cancer (BC). The expression of 13 
      candidate lncRNAs was investigated in 80 BC and matched adjacent normal tissues via 
      quantitative real-time PCR. The differentially expressed lncRNAs were then analyzed 
      in 240 serum samples (training set) and three lncRNAs (MEG3, SNHG16 and MALAT1) 
      showed differential expression. A logistic regression model was constructed using 
      the training set and validated in an independent cohort of 200 serum samples 
      (validation set). The AUC of the three-lncRNA panel was 0.865 for the training and 
      0.828 for the validation set. The diagnostic performance of the lncRNA panel for Ta, 
      T1, and T2-T4 were 0.778, 0.805, and 0.880, which were significantly higher than 
      those of urine cytology (0.548, 0.604, and 0.682, respectively). Moreover, we 
      determined that low expression of MEG3 was associated with poor recurrence-free 
      survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis (p = 0.028), univariate Cox analysis (p = 0.033) 
      and multivariate Cox analysis (p = 0.046). In conclusion, our results identified a 
      three-lncRNA panel for BC diagnosis and a recurrence-independent prognostic factor, 
      MEG3.

TI  - Astrocyte elevated gene-1 and c-Myc cooperate to promote hepatocarcinogenesis in 
      mice.
PG  - 915-29
LID - 10.1002/hep.27339 [doi]
AB  - Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) and c-Myc are overexpressed in human 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) functioning as oncogenes. AEG-1 is transcriptionally 
      regulated by c-Myc, and AEG-1 itself induces c-Myc by activating the 
      Wnt/β-catenin-signaling pathway. We now document the cooperation of AEG-1 and c-Myc 
      in promoting hepatocarcinogenesis by analyzing hepatocyte-specific transgenic mice 
      expressing either AEG-1 (albumin [Alb]/AEG-1), c-Myc (Alb/c-Myc), or both 
      (Alb/AEG-1/c-Myc). Wild-type and Alb/AEG-1 mice did not develop spontaneous HCC. 
      Alb/c-Myc mice developed spontaneous HCC without distant metastasis, whereas 
      Alb/AEG-1/c-Myc mice developed highly aggressive HCC with frank metastasis to the 
      lungs. Induction of carcinogenesis by N-nitrosodiethylamine significantly 
      accelerated the kinetics of tumor formation in all groups. However, in 
      Alb/AEG-1/c-Myc, the effect was markedly pronounced with lung metastasis. In vitro 
      analysis showed that Alb/AEG-1/c-Myc hepatocytes acquired increased proliferation 
      and transformative potential with sustained activation of prosurvival and 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition-signaling pathways. RNA-sequencing analysis 
      identified a unique gene signature in livers of Alb/AEG-1/c-Myc mice that was not 
      observed when either AEG-1 or c-Myc was overexpressed. Specifically, Alb/AEG-1/c-Myc 
      mice overexpressed maternally imprinted noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as Rian, 
      Meg-3, and Mirg, which are implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis. Knocking down these 
      ncRNAs significantly inhibited proliferation and invasion by Alb/AEG-1/c-Myc 
      hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: Our studies reveal a novel cooperative oncogenic effect of 
      AEG-1 and c-Myc that might explain the mechanism of aggressive HCC. Alb/AEG-1/c-Myc 
      mice provide a useful model to understand the molecular mechanism of cooperation 
      between these two oncogenes and other molecules involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. 
      This model might also be of use for evaluating novel therapeutic strategies 
      targeting HCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate maternal nutrition during early fetal development can create 
      permanent alterations in the offspring, leading to poor health outcomes. While 
      nutrients involved in one-carbon cycle metabolism are important to fetal growth, 
      associations with specific nutrients remain inconsistent. This study estimates 
      associations between maternal vitamins B12, B6 (pyridoxal phosphate [PLP] and 
      4-pyridoxic acid [PA]), and homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations, offspring weight 
      (birth weight and 3-year weight gain), and DNA methylation at four differentially 
      methylated regions (DMRs) known to be involved in fetal growth and development (H19, 
      MEG3, SGCE/PEG10, and PLAGL1). METHODS: Study participants (n = 496) with biomarker 
      and birth weight data were enrolled as part of the Newborn Epigenetics STudy. Weight 
      gain data were available for 273 offspring. Among 484 mother-infant pairs, DNA 
      methylation at regulatory sequences of genomically imprinted genes was measured in 
      umbilical cord blood DNA using bisulfite pyrosequencing. We used generalized linear 
      models to estimate associations. RESULTS: Multivariate adjusted regression models 
      revealed an inverse association between maternal Hcy concentration and male birth 
      weight (β = -210.40, standard error (SE) = 102.08, p = 0.04). The offspring of the 
      mothers in the highest quartile of B12 experienced lower weight gain between birth 
      and 3 years compared to the offspring of the mothers in the lowest (β = -2203.03, 
      SE = 722.49, p = 0.003). Conversely, maternal PLP was associated with higher weight 
      gain in males; higher maternal PLP concentrations were also associated with 
      offspring DNA methylation levels at the MEG3 DMR (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: While 
      maternal concentrations of B12, B6, and Hcy do not associate with birth weight 
      overall, they may play an important role in 3-year weight gain. This is the first 
      study to report an association between maternal PLP and methylation at the MEG3 DMR 
      which may be an important epigenetic tag for maternal B vitamin adequacy.

TI  - Maternal vitamin D, DNA methylation at imprint regulatory regions and offspring 
      weight at birth, 1 year and 3 years.
PG  - 587-593
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2017.160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with poor 
      birth outcomes in some studies, but few have examined weight beyond birth. In 
      addition, little is known about how vitamin D influences DNA methylation of 
      regulatory regions known to be involved in growth, as possible mediators to weight 
      status in offspring. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We conducted linear regressions to assess 
      maternal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) by quartile and birth weight for 
      gestational age z-score, 1-year weight-for-length z-score and 3-year body mass index 
      (BMI) z-score among 476 mother/infant dyads from a prospective cohort. We assessed 
      maternal 25(OH)D and infant DNA methylation at nine differentially methylated 
      regions (DMRs) of genomically imprinted genes with known functions in fetal growth, 
      including H19, IGF2, MEG3, MEG3-IG, MEST, NNAT, PEG3, PLAGL1 and SGCE/PEG10. 
      RESULTS: Mean (standard deviation, s.d.) maternal 25(OH)D was 41.1 (14.2) nmol l(-m) 
      at a mean (s.d.) of 13.2 (5.5) weeks gestation. After adjustment for potential 
      confounders, the first (Q1) and second (Q2) quartiles of 25(OH)D, compared to the 
      fourth (Q4), were associated with lower birth weight for gestational age z-scores 
      (-0.43 units; CI: -0.79, -0.07; P=0.02 for Q1 and -0.56 units; CI: -0.89, -0.23; 
      P=0.001 for Q2). Q1 compared to Q4 was associated with higher 1-year 
      weight-for-length z-scores (0.78 units; 0.08, 1.54; P=0.04) and higher 3-year BMI 
      z-scores (0.83 units; 0.11, 0.93; P=0.02). We did not observe associations between 
      maternal 25(OH)D and methylation for any of the nine DMRs after correcting for 
      multiple testing. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced maternal 25(OH)D was associated with lower 
      birth weight for gestational age z-scores but higher 1-year weight-for-length and 
      3-year BMI z-scores in offspring. However, 25(OH)D does not appear to be operating 
      through the regulatory sequences of the genomically imprinted genes we examined.

      miRNA-mRNA in lung adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 2285-95
LID - 10919 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: RNA-seq data and miRNA-seq data of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) were 
      analyzed to identify critical long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and disclose molecular 
      pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA-seq data and miRNA-seq data were downloaded 
      from TCGA. Differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) and microRNAs (DEMs) were 
      revealed by two sample t-test. |Fold change| > 2 and p-value < 0.01 were set as the 
      cutoffs. Univariate Cox regression was performed to disclose prognostic lncRNAs. 
      Information about miRNA-lncRNA interactions and miRNA-mRNA interactions were 
      acquired from miRcode and miRTarBase, respectively. A miRNA-lncRNA-mRNA regulatory 
      network was then constructed, from which regulatory modules were identified. 
      Functional enrichment analysis was performed with DAVID. RESULTS: A total of 57 DELs 
      and 118 DEMs were identified from 507 LUAD compared with 19 normal samples. Three 
      DELs, including MEG3, MIAT and MIR4697HG, were associated with clinical features, 
      while nine DELs (LINC00115, LINC00265, LINC01001, LINC01002, MIR22HG, NFYC-AS1, 
      SNHG10, THUMPD3-AS1 and TMPO-AS1) were revealed to be prognostic biomarkers. A 
      regulatory network including 61 miRNA-lncRNA interactions and 304 miRNA-mRNA 
      interactions was constructed, from which 19 lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules 
      were identified. Among the modules, MEG3 and MIAT may play important roles in the 
      development of LUAD by interactions with miR-106 which then regulated the MAPK9 to 
      involve in MAPK signaling pathways. LINC00115 might interact with miR-7 to regulate 
      FGF2 to participate in pathways in cancer. CONCLUSIONS: MEG3, MIAT, LINC00115 may be 
      underlying therapeutic targets for LUAD functioning as ceRNAs for regulation of 
      miRNA-mRNA.

TI  - Newborns of obese parents have altered DNA methylation patterns at imprinted genes.
PG  - 650-7
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2013.193 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated associations between 
      periconceptional environmental exposures and health status of the offspring in later 
      life. Although these environmentally related effects have been attributed to 
      epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation shifts at imprinted genes, little is 
      known about the potential effects of maternal and paternal preconceptional 
      overnutrition or obesity. OBJECTIVE: We examined parental preconceptional obesity in 
      relation to DNA methylation profiles at multiple human imprinted genes important in 
      normal growth and development, such as: maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), 
      mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST), paternally expressed gene 3 (PEG3), 
      pleiomorphic adenoma gene-like 1 (PLAGL1), epsilon sarcoglycan and paternally 
      expressed gene 10 (SGCE/PEG10) and neuronatin (NNAT). METHODS: We measured 
      methylation percentages at the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by bisulfite 
      pyrosequencing in DNA extracted from umbilical cord blood leukocytes of 92 newborns. 
      Preconceptional obesity, defined as BMI ⩾30 kg m(-2), was ascertained through 
      standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders and 
      cluster effects, paternal obesity was significantly associated with lower 
      methylation levels at the MEST (β=-2.57; s.e.=0.95; P=0.008), PEG3 (β=-1.71; 
      s.e.=0.61; P=0.005) and NNAT (β=-3.59; s.e.=1.76; P=0.04) DMRs. Changes related to 
      maternal obesity detected at other loci were as follows: β-coefficient was +2.58 
      (s.e.=1.00; P=0.01) at the PLAGL1 DMR and -3.42 (s.e.=1.69; P=0.04) at the MEG3 DMR. 
      CONCLUSION: We found altered methylation outcomes at multiple imprint regulatory 
      regions in children born to obese parents, compared with children born to non-obese 
      parents. In spite of the small sample size, our data suggest a preconceptional 
      influence of parental life-style or overnutrition on the (re)programming of imprint 
      marks during gametogenesis and early development. More specifically, the significant 
      and independent association between paternal obesity and the offspring's methylation 
      status suggests the susceptibility of the developing sperm for environmental 
      insults. The acquired imprint instability may be carried onto the next generation 
      and increase the risk for chronic diseases in adulthood.

      maternally expressed gene 3 expression with clinical features, treatment response, 
      and survival profiles in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Bone marrow 
      samples of 122 de novo patients with acute myeloid leukemia (prior to treatment) and 
      30 healthy donors (after enrollment) were collected, and long noncoding RNA 
      maternally expressed gene 3 expression was detected by reverse transcription 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction. According to median value of long noncoding 
      RNA maternally expressed gene 3 expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 
      they were divided into long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 high 
      expression and low expression patients (which were further categorized as low---, 
      low--, and low- expression patients). RESULTS: Long noncoding RNA maternally 
      expressed gene 3 expression was decreased in patients with acute myeloid leukemia 
      compared to healthy donors. Besides, receiver operating characteristic curve 
      displayed that long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 distinguished patients 
      with acute myeloid leukemia from healthy donors. In patients with acute myeloid 
      leukemia, long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 low expression was 
      associated with poor-risk stratification but was not correlated with age, gender, 
      French-American-Britain classification, or white blood cell level. For prognosis, 
      complete remission rate was lowest in long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 
      low--- expression patients, followed by long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 
      3 low-- expression patients, long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 low- 
      expression patients, and was highest in long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 
      3 high expression patients; Kaplan-Meier curves displayed that lower long noncoding 
      RNA maternally expressed gene 3 expression was associated with reduced event-free 
      survival and overall survival; Cox regression analysis showed that lower long 
      noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 expression independently predicted 
      decreased event-free survival and worse overall survival in patients with acute 
      myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: Long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 may 
      function as a novel marker for effective surveillance and management of acute 
      myeloid leukemia.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Our previous study has demonstrated that down-regulation of 
      miR-376a might contribute to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but 
      the mechanism underlying this down-regulation remains obscure. METHODS/RESULTS: 
      histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor increased the level of miR-376a in L02 and Huh7 
      cells by up-regulating the acetylation level of histone 3 at the Maternally 
      expressed 3 (Meg3) differentially methylated region (DMR). Interestingly, HDAC9, a 
      histone deacetylase responsible for deacetylating lysine 18 of histone 3 (H3K18), 
      was identified as the target of miR-376a. In addition, HDAC9 siRNA increased the 
      expression of miR-376a by up-regulating the global histone H3K18 acetylation level, 
      with Meg3 DMR included. Finally, miR-376a and HDAC9 were inversely correlated in 
      HCC. CONCLUSION: HDAC9 plays an important role both as effects and targets of 
      miR-376a.

TI  - Long non-coding RNA Ftx promotes osteosarcoma progression via the epithelial to 
      mesenchymal transition mechanism and is associated with poor prognosis in patients 
      with osteosarcoma.
PG  - 4503-4511
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Long non-coding RNA Ftx (lncRNA Ftx) is involved in a variety of cancers. 
      However, the association between lncRNA Ftx and osteosarcoma is still unclear. In 
      this study, we investigated the correlation between lncRNA Ftx and osteosarcoma, and 
      the regulative effect of Ftx on the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells, as 
      well as its molecular mechanism. METHODS: Expression levels of lncRNA Ftx in 
      osteosarcoma tissues and adjacent non-tumor corresponding tissues (ANCTs) were 
      detected using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Differences in patient survival 
      were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test. The Cox regression 
      analysis was used for univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic values. 
      Human osteosarcoma cell lines Saos2 and HOS were transfected with the pcDNA-Ftx 
      constructs. The scratch wound healing assay and Transwell assay were used to assess 
      cell migration and invasion capability, respectively. Western blot analysis was 
      conducted to investigate the expression of mesenchymal and epithelial markers. 
      RESULTS: The results showed that the lncRNA Ftx group was higher in osteosarcoma 
      tissues compared with the ANCTs group. Expression of lncRNA Ftx was correlated with 
      the clinical stage and distant metastasis (P<0.05). The overall survival rate was 
      lower in the high lncRNA Ftx group than in the low lncRNA Ftx group (log-rank test, 
      P<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that in osteosarcoma patients, higher lncRNA 
      MEG3, advanced clinical stage, and distant metastasis were all independent 
      predictors of overall survival. Cell research showed that transfection of lncRNA Ftx 
      significantly promoted the migration and invasion ability of osteosarcoma cells. In 
      addition, E-cadherin was decreased, while N-cadherin and Snail-1 were increased, at 
      both the protein and mRNA levels. Pre-treatment with Snail-1 siRNA abrogated the 
      promotion effect of Ftx on the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of lncRNA Ftx could not only be a biomarker for 
      progression and prognosis of osteosarcoma, but also could regulate the development 
      of osteosarcoma via the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) mechanism.

TI  - Maternal cadmium, iron and zinc levels, DNA methylation and birth weight.
PG  - 20
LID - 10.1186/s40360-015-0020-2 [doi]
LID - 20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cadmium (Cd) is a ubiquitous and environmentally persistent toxic metal 
      that has been implicated in neurotoxicity, carcinogenesis and obesity and essential 
      metals including zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) may alter these outcomes. However 
      mechanisms underlying these relationships remain limited. METHODS: We examined 
      whether maternal Cd levels during early pregnancy were associated with offspring DNA 
      methylation at regulatory sequences of genomically imprinted genes and weight at 
      birth, and whether Fe and Zn altered these associations. Cd, Fe and Zn were measured 
      in maternal blood of 319 women ≤ 12 weeks gestation. Offspring umbilical cord blood 
      leukocyte DNA methylation at regulatory differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of 
      8 imprinted genes was measured using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Regression models 
      were used to examine the relationships among Cd, Fe, Zn, and DMR methylation and 
      birth weight. RESULTS: Elevated maternal blood Cd levels were associated with lower 
      birth weight (p = 0.03). Higher maternal blood Cd levels were also associated with 
      lower offspring methylation at the PEG3 DMR in females (β = 0.55, se = 0.17, p = 
      0.05), and at the MEG3 DMR in males (β = 0.72, se = 0.3, p = 0.08), however the 
      latter association was not statistically significant. Associations between Cd and 
      PEG3 and PLAGL1 DNA methylation were stronger in infants born to women with low 
      concentrations of Fe (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest the association 
      between pre-natal Cd and offspring DNA methylation at regulatory sequences of 
      imprinted genes may be sex- and gene-specific. Essential metals such as Zn may 
      mitigate DNA methylation response to Cd exposure. Larger studies are required.

TI  - Armored long non-coding RNA MEG3 targeting EGFR based on recombinant MS2 
      bacteriophage virus-like particles against hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 23988-4004
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.8115 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers 
      worldwide. However, the treatment of patients with HCC is particularly challenging. 
      Long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) has been identified as a 
      potential suppressor of several types of tumors, but the delivery of long RNA 
      remains problematic, limiting its applications. In the present study, we designed a 
      novel delivery system based on MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) crosslinked with GE11 
      polypeptide. This vector was found to be fast, effective and safe for the targeted 
      delivery of lncRNA MEG3 RNA to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive 
      HCC cell lines without the activation of EGFR downstream pathways, and significantly 
      attenuated both in vitro and in vivo tumor cell growth. Our study also revealed that 
      the targeted delivery was mainly dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis and MEG3 
      RNA suppresses tumor growth mainly via increasing the expression of p53 and its 
      downstream gene GDF15, but decreasing the expression of MDM2. Thus, this vector is 
      promising as a novel delivery system and may facilitate a new approach to lncRNA 
      based cancer therapy.

AB  - Transcription of the proto-oncogene SPHK1 is regulated by KHPS1, an antisense RNA 
      that activates SPHK1 expression by forming a triple-helical RNA-DNA-DNA structure at 
      the SPHK1 enhancer. Triplex-mediated tethering of KHPS1 to its target gene is 
      required for recruitment of E2F1 and p300 and transcription of the RNA derived from 
      the SPHK1 enhancer (eRNA-Sphk1). eRNA-Sphk1 evicts CTCF, which insulates the 
      enhancer from the SPHK1 promoter, thus facilitating SPHK1 expression. Genomic 
      deletion of the triplex-forming sequence attenuates SPHK1 expression, leading to 
      decreased cell migration and invasion. Replacement of the triplex-forming region 
      (TFR) of KHPS1 by the TFR of the lncRNA MEG3 tethers KHPS1 to the MEG3 target gene 
      TGFBR1, underscoring the interchangeability and anchoring function of sequences 
      involved in triplex formation. Altogether, the results reveal a triplex-driven 
      feedforward mechanism involving lncRNA-dependent induction of eRNA, which enhances 
      expression of specific target genes.

AB  - Adult height is a highly heritable trait. Here we identified 31.6 million sequence 
      variants by whole-genome sequencing of 8,453 Icelanders and tested them for 
      association with adult height by imputing them into 88,835 Icelanders. Here we 
      discovered 13 novel height associations by testing four different models including 
      parent-of-origin (|β|=0.4-10.6 cm). The minor alleles of three parent-of-origin 
      signals associate with less height only when inherited from the father and are 
      located within imprinted regions (IGF2-H19 and DLK1-MEG3). We also examined the 
      association of these sequence variants in a set of 12,645 Icelanders with birth 
      length measurements. Two of the novel variants, (IGF2-H19 and TET1), show 
      significant association with both adult height and birth length, indicating a role 
      in early growth regulation. Among the parent-of-origin signals, we observed opposing 
      parental effects raising questions about underlying mechanisms. These findings 
      demonstrate that common variations affect human growth by parental imprinting.

      cell markers in teratoma.

LID - 10.1262/jrd.2014-089 [doi]
AB  - The distal region of mouse chromosome 12 harbors the Dlk1-Dio3 domain, is essential 
      for normal development and encodes maternally expressed noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), 
      including Gtl2 as well as paternally expressed proteins.Gtl2 works as a tumor 
      suppressor in several types of human cancer cell lines; however, whether this 
      reflects its function in vivo is unknown. Deleting Gtl2 from the maternal allele 
      (Gtl2((-/+))) results in loss of expression of Gtl2 and decreased expression of 
      downstream ncRNAs, including many miRNAs. To determine the role of ncRNAs in 
      tumorigenesis, we induced teratomas by engrafting E6.5 embryos (wildtype or 
      Gtl2((-/+))) under the kidney capsule of scid mice. Some teratomas derived from the 
      Gtl2((-/+)) embryos exhibited hypertrophic growth, suggesting that ncRNAs, including 
      Gtl2, may act as tumor suppressors in vivo. Microarray analysis of miRNAs expressed 
      by Gtl2((-/+)) teratomas revealed decreased expression of 28 miRNAs encoded by the 
      Dlk1-Dio3 domain, low expression of embryonic stem cell-specific miRNAs and 
      dysregulation of miRNAs involved in tumorigenesis. This study suggests that 
      downregulation of ncRNAs in the Dlk1-Dio3 domain leads to enhanced teratoma growth 
      and repression of stem cell markers.

LID - 6044
AB  - Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PCCs/PGLs) are neural crest-derived tumours 
      with a very strong genetic component. Here we report the first integrated genomic 
      examination of a large collection of PCC/PGL. SNP array analysis reveals distinct 
      copy-number patterns associated with genetic background. Whole-exome sequencing 
      shows a low mutation rate of 0.3 mutations per megabase, with few recurrent somatic 
      mutations in genes not previously associated with PCC/PGL. DNA methylation arrays 
      and miRNA sequencing identify DNA methylation changes and miRNA expression clusters 
      strongly associated with messenger RNA expression profiling. Overexpression of the 
      miRNA cluster 182/96/183 is specific in SDHB-mutated tumours and induces malignant 
      traits, whereas silencing of the imprinted DLK1-MEG3 miRNA cluster appears as a 
      potential driver in a subgroup of sporadic tumours. Altogether, the complete genomic 
      landscape of PCC/PGL is mainly driven by distinct germline and/or somatic mutations 
      in susceptibility genes and reveals different molecular entities, characterized by a 
      set of unique genomic alterations.

AB  - Childhood stressors including physical abuse predict adult cancer risk. Prior 
      research portrays this finding as an indirect mechanism that operates through coping 
      behaviors, including adult smoking, or through increased toxic exposures during 
      childhood. Little is known about potential direct causal mechanisms between 
      early-life stressors and adult cancer. Because prenatal conditions can affect gene 
      expression by altering DNA methylation, with implications for adult health, we 
      hypothesize that maternal stress may program methylation of cancer-linked genes 
      during gametogenesis. To illustrate this hypothesis, we related maternal social 
      resources to methylation at the imprinted MEG3 differentially methylated regulatory 
      region, which has been linked to multiple cancer types. Mothers (n = 489) from a 
      diverse birth cohort (Durham, North Carolina) provided newborns' cord blood and 
      completed a questionnaire. Newborns of currently married mothers showed lower 
      (-0.321 SD, p < .05) methylation compared to newborns of never-married mothers, who 
      did not differ from newborns whose mothers were cohabiting and others (adjusted for 
      demographics). MEG3 DNA methylation levels were also lower when maternal 
      grandmothers co-resided before pregnancy (-0.314 SD, p < .05). A 1-SD increase in 
      prenatal neighborhood disadvantage also predicted higher methylation (-0.137 SD, 
      p < .05). In conclusion, we found that maternal social resources may result in 
      differential methylation of MEG3, which demonstrates a potential partial mechanism 
      priming socially disadvantaged newborns for later risk of some cancers.

TI  - Disordered Regions of Mixed Lineage Leukemia 4 (MLL4) Protein Are Capable of RNA 
      Binding.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of cellular 
      processes and are extensively involved in the development of different cancers; 
      including leukemias. As one of the accepted methods of lncRNA function is affecting 
      chromatin structure; lncRNA binding has been shown for different chromatin 
      modifiers. Histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) are also subject of lncRNA 
      regulation as demonstrated for example in the case of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 
      (PRC2). Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) proteins that catalyze the methylation of H3K4 
      have been implicated in several different cancers; yet many details of their 
      regulation and targeting remain elusive. In this work we explored the RNA binding 
      capability of two; so far uncharacterized regions of MLL4; with the aim of shedding 
      light to the existence of possible regulatory lncRNA interactions of the protein. We 
      demonstrated that both regions; one that contains a predicted RNA binding sequence 
      and one that does not; are capable of binding to different RNA constructs in vitro. 
      To our knowledge, these findings are the first to indicate that an MLL protein 
      itself is capable of lncRNA binding.

TI  - Erasure of DNA methylation, genomic imprints, and epimutations in a primordial 
      germ-cell model derived from mouse pluripotent stem cells.
PG  - 9545-50
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1610259113 [doi]
AB  - The genome-wide depletion of 5-methylcytosines (5meCs) caused by passive dilution 
      through DNA synthesis without daughter strand methylation and active enzymatic 
      processes resulting in replacement of 5meCs with unmethylated cytosines is a 
      hallmark of primordial germ cells (PGCs). Although recent studies have shown that in 
      vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) 
      mimics the in vivo differentiation of epiblast cells to PGCs, how DNA methylation 
      status of PGCLCs resembles the dynamics of 5meC erasure in embryonic PGCs remains 
      controversial. Here, by differential detection of genome-wide 5meC and 
      5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmeC) distributions by deep sequencing, we show that 
      PGCLCs derived from mouse PSCs recapitulated the process of genome-wide DNA 
      demethylation in embryonic PGCs, including significant demethylation of imprint 
      control regions (ICRs) associated with increased mRNA expression of the 
      corresponding imprinted genes. Although 5hmeCs were also significantly diminished in 
      PGCLCs, they retained greater amounts of 5hmeCs than intragonadal PGCs. The genomes 
      of both PGCLCs and PGCs selectively retained both 5meCs and 5hmeCs at a small number 
      of repeat sequences such as GSAT_MM, of which the significant retention of 
      bisulfite-resistant cytosines was corroborated by reanalysis of previously published 
      whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data for intragonadal PGCs. PSCs harboring 
      abnormal hypermethylation at ICRs of the Dlk1-Gtl2-Dio3 imprinting cluster 
      diminished these 5meCs upon differentiation to PGCLCs, resulting in transcriptional 
      reactivation of the Gtl2 gene. These observations support the usefulness of PGCLCs 
      in studying the germline epigenetic erasure including imprinted genes, epimutations, 
      and erasure-resistant loci, which may be involved in transgenerational epigenetic 
      inheritance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between long noncoding 
      RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumor tissues and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) aggressiveness 
      and survival. METHODS: We correlated the lncRNAs in tumor tissues with HCC survival 
      and clinicopathological features based on Gene Expression Omnibus expression profile 
      GSE36376. RESULTS: Eight lncRNAs and 240 HCC patients were included. Cox regression 
      analysis indicated that HULC was a positive factor for HCC overall survival (HR = 
      0.885, 95% CI = 0.797-0.983, and P = 0.023) and disease-free survival time (HR = 
      0.913, 95% CI = 0.835-0.998, and P = 0.045). H19 and UCA1 were both demonstrated to 
      be risk factors of HCC disease-free survival in multivariate Cox model (HR = 1.071, 
      95% CI = 1.01-1.137, and P = 0.022 and HR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.092-5.273, and P = 
      0.029, resp.). But Kaplan-Meier method showed no significant association between 
      UCA1 and HCC disease-free survival (log rank P = 0.616). Logistic regression 
      demonstrated that H19 was overexpressed in HBV-infected patients (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 
      = 1.008-1.29, and P = 0.037). HULC had a significant association with vascular 
      invasion (OR = 0.648, 95% CI = 0.523-0.803, and P < 0.001). H19 and MEG3 were both 
      considered to be risk factors for high AFP level (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.277-1.646, 
      and P < 0.001 and OR = 1.613, 95% CI = 1.1-2.365, and P = 0.014, resp.). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Contributing to decreased susceptibility to vascular invasion, 
      upregulation of HULC in tumor tissues was positively associated with HCC survival. 
      In contrast, H19 overexpression might be risk factor for HCC aggressiveness and poor 
      outcomes.

TI  - Epigenetic regulation of Newborns' imprinted genes related to gestational growth: 
      patterning by parental race/ethnicity and maternal socioeconomic status.
PG  - 639-47
LID - 10.1136/jech-2014-204781 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children born to parents with lower income and education are at risk for 
      obesity and later-life risk of common chronic diseases, and epigenetics has been 
      hypothesised to link these associations. However, epigenetic targets are unknown. We 
      focus on a cluster of well-characterised genomically imprinted genes because their 
      monoallelic expression is regulated by DNA methylation at differentially methylated 
      regions (DMRs), are critical in fetal growth, and DNA methylation patterns at birth 
      have been associated with increased risk of birth weight extremes and overweight 
      status or obesity in early childhood. METHODS: We measured DNA methylation at DMRs 
      regulating genomically imprinted domains (IGF2/H19, DLK1/MEG3, NNAT and PLAGL1) 
      using umbilical cord blood leucocytes from 619 infants recruited in Durham, North 
      Carolina in 2010-2011. We examined differences in DNA methylation levels by 
      race/ethnicity of both parents, and the role that maternal socioeconomic status 
      (SES) may play in the association between race/ethnic epigenetic differences. 
      RESULTS: Unadjusted race/ethnic differences only were evident for DMRs regulating 
      MEG3 and IGF2; race/ethnic differences persisted in IGF2/H19 and NNAT after 
      accounting for income and education. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that parental 
      factors may not only influence DNA methylation, but also do so in ways that vary by 
      DMR. Findings support the hypothesis that epigenetics may link the observed lower 
      SES during the prenatal period and poor outcomes such as low birth weight; lower 
      birth weight has previously been associated with adult-onset chronic diseases and 
      conditions that include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and some cancers.

TI  - Prognostic impact of c-Rel nuclear expression and REL amplification and crosstalk 
      between c-Rel and the p53 pathway in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
PG  - 23157-80
AB  - Dysregulated NF-κB signaling is critical for lymphomagenesis. The regulation, 
      function, and clinical relevance of c-Rel/NF-κB activation in diffuse large B-cell 
      lymphoma (DLBCL) have not been well studied. In this study we analyzed the 
      prognostic significance and gene-expression signature of c-Rel nuclear expression as 
      surrogate of c-Rel activation in 460 patients with de novo DLBCL. Nuclear c-Rel 
      expression, observed in 137 (26.3%) DLBCL patients frequently associated with 
      extranoal origin, did not show significantly prognostic impact in the overall- or 
      germinal center B-like-DLBCL cohort, likely due to decreased pAKT and Myc levels, 
      up-regulation of FOXP3, FOXO3, MEG3 and other tumor suppressors coincided with c-Rel 
      nuclear expression, as well as the complicated relationships between NF-κB members 
      and their overlapping function. However, c-Rel nuclear expression correlated with 
      significantly poorer survival in p63+ and BCL-2- activated B-cell-like-DLBCL, and in 
      DLBCL patients with TP53 mutations. Multivariate analysis indicated that after 
      adjusting clinical parameters, c-Rel positivity was a significantly adverse 
      prognostic factor in DLBCL patients with wild type TP53. Gene expression profiling 
      suggested dysregulations of cell cycle, metabolism, adhesion, and migration 
      associated with c-Rel activation. In contrast, REL amplification did not correlate 
      with c-Rel nuclear expression and patient survival, likely due to co-amplification 
      of genes that negatively regulate NF-κB activation. These insights into the 
      expression, prognostic impact, regulation and function of c-Rel as well as its 
      crosstalk with the p53 pathway underscore the importance of c-Rel and have 
      significant therapeutic implications.

TI  - Systematic identification and comparison of expressed profiles of lncRNAs and

      cells.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs 
      (circRNAs) involve in germ cell development. However, little is known about the 
      functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs and circRNAs in self-renewal and differentiation 
      of germline stem cells. Therefore, we explored the expression profiles of mRNAs, 
      lncRNAs, and circRNAs in male and female mouse germline stem cells by 
      high-throughput sequencing. We identified 18573 novel lncRNAs and 18822 circRNAs in 
      the germline stem cells and further confirmed the existence of these lncRNAs and 
      circRNAs by RT-PCR. The results showed that male and female germline stem cells had 
      similar GDNF signaling mechanism. Subsequently, 8115 mRNAs, 3996 lncRNAs, and 921 
      circRNAs exhibited sex-biased expression that may be associated with germline stem 
      cell acquisition of the sex-specific properties required for differentiation into 
      gametes. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed different 
      functions for these sex-biased lncRNAs and circRNAs. We further constructed 
      correlated expression networks including coding-noncoding co-expression and 
      competing endogenous RNAs with bioinformatics. Co-expression analysis showed 
      hundreds of lncRNAs were correlated with sex differences in mouse germline stem 
      cells, including lncRNA Gm11851, lncRNA Gm12840, lncRNA 4930405O22Rik, and lncRNA 
      Atp10d. CeRNA network inferred that lncRNA Meg3 and cirRNA Igf1r could bind 
      competitively with miRNA-15a-5p increasing target gene Inha, Acsl3, Kif21b, and 
      Igfbp2 expressions. These findings provide novel perspectives on lncRNAs and 
      circRNAs and lay a foundation for future research into the regulating mechanisms of 
      lncRNAs and circRNAs in germline stem cells.

TI  - Profound parental bias associated with chromosome 14 acquired uniparental disomy 
      indicates targeting of an imprinted locus.
PG  - 2069-74
LID - 10.1038/leu.2015.130 [doi]
AB  - Acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a common finding in myeloid malignancies and 
      typically acts to convert a somatically acquired heterozygous mutation to 
      homozygosity. We sought to identify the target of chromosome 14 aUPD (aUPD14), a 
      recurrent abnormality in myeloid neoplasms and population cohorts of elderly 
      individuals. We identified 29 cases with aUPD14q that defined a minimal affected 
      region (MAR) of 11.2 Mb running from 14q32.12 to the telomere. Exome sequencing 
      (n=7) did not identify recurrently mutated genes, but methylation-specific PCR at 
      the imprinted MEG3-DLK1 locus located within the MAR demonstrated loss of maternal 
      chromosome 14 and gain of paternal chromosome 14 (P<0.0001), with the degree of 
      methylation imbalance correlating with the level of aUPD (r=0.76; P=0.0001). The 
      absence of driver gene mutations in the exomes of three individuals with aUPD14q but 
      no known haematological disorder suggests that aUPD14q may be sufficient to drive 
      clonal haemopoiesis. Analysis of cases with both aUPD14q and JAK2 V617F (n=11) 
      indicated that aUPD14q may be an early event in some cases but a late event in 
      others. We conclude that aUPD14q is a recurrent abnormality that targets an 
      imprinted locus and may promote clonal haemopoiesis either as an initiating event or 
      as a secondary change.

TI  - Regulation of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus by allele-specific enhancer activity.
PG  - 92-101
LID - 10.1101/gad.270413.115 [doi]
AB  - Genomic imprinting is a critical developmental process characteristic of parent of 
      origin-specific gene expression. It is well accepted that differentially 
      DNA-methylated regions (DMRs) and enhancers are two major classes of cis-elements 
      determining parent of origin-specific gene expression, with each recruiting 
      different sets of transcription factors. Previously, we identified the AF4/FMR2 
      (AFF) family protein AFF3 within the transcription elongation complex SEC-L3. Here, 
      we report that AFF3 can specifically bind both gametic DMRs (gDMRs) and enhancers 
      within imprinted loci in an allele-specific manner. We identify the molecular 
      regulators involved in the recruitment of AFF3 to gDMRs and provide mechanistic 
      insight into the requirement of AFF3 at an enhancer for the expression of an ∼200-kb 
      polycistronic transcript within the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus. Our data suggest that 
      the heterochromatic environment at the gDMR reinforces silencing of its related 
      enhancer by controlling the binding and activity of AFF3 in an allele-specific 
      manner. In summary, this study provides molecular details about the regulation of 
      dosage-critical imprinted gene expression through the regulated binding of the 
      transcription elongation factor AFF3 between a DMR and an enhancer.

TI  - DNA Methylation of Regulatory Regions of Imprinted Genes at Birth and Its Relation 
      to Infant Temperament.
PG  - 59-67
AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA methylation of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of 
      imprinted genes is relevant to neurodevelopment. METHODS: DNA methylation status of 
      the DMRs of nine imprinted genes in umbilical cord blood leukocytes was analyzed in 
      relation to infant behaviors and temperament (n = 158). RESULTS: MEG3 DMR levels 
      were positively associated with internalizing (β = 0.15, P = 0.044) and surgency (β 
      = 0.19, P = 0.018) behaviors, after adjusting for birth weight, gender, gestational 
      age at birth, maternal age at delivery, race/ethnicity, education level, smoking 
      status, parity, and a history of anxiety or depression. Higher methylation levels at 
      the intergenic MEG3-IG methylation regions were associated with surgency (β = 0.28, 
      P = 0.0003) and PEG3 was positively related to externalizing (β = 0.20, P = 0.01) 
      and negative affectivity (β = 0.18, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: While the small sample 
      size limits inference, these pilot data support gene-specific associations between 
      epigenetic differences in regulatory regions of imprinted domains at birth and later 
      infant temperament.

TI  - Linc-ing Circulating Long Non-coding RNAs to the Diagnosis and Malignant Prediction 
      of Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms of the Pancreas.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that lacks 
      effective biomarkers for early detection. We hypothesized that circulating long 
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may act as diagnostic markers of incidentally-detected 
      cystic PDAC precursors known as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and 
      predictors of their pathology/histological classification. Using NanoString 
      nCounter® technology, we measured the abundance of 28 candidate lncRNAs in 
      pre-operative plasma from a cohort of pathologically-confirmed IPMN cases of various 
      grades of severity and non-diseased controls. Results showed that two lncRNAs (GAS5 
      and SRA) aided in differentiating IPMNs from controls. An 8-lncRNA signature 
      (including ADARB2-AS1, ANRIL, GLIS3-AS1, LINC00472, MEG3, PANDA, PVT1, and UCA1) had 
      greater accuracy than standard clinical and radiologic features in distinguishing 
      'aggressive/malignant' IPMNs that warrant surgical removal from 'indolent/benign' 
      IPMNs that can be observed. When the 8-lncRNA signature was combined with plasma 
      miRNA data and quantitative 'radiomic' imaging features, the accuracy of predicting 
      IPMN pathological classification improved. Our findings provide novel information on 
      the ability to detect lncRNAs in plasma from patients with IPMNs and suggest that an 
      lncRNA-based blood test may have utility as a diagnostic adjunct for identifying 
      IPMNs and their pathology, especially when incorporated with biomarkers such as 
      miRNAs, quantitative imaging features, and clinical data.

TI  - Maternal inflammatory diet and adverse pregnancy outcomes: Circulating cytokines and 
      genomic imprinting as potential regulators?
PG  - 688-697
LID - 10.1080/15592294.2017.1347241 [doi]
AB  - Excessive inflammation during pregnancy alters homeostatic mechanisms of the 
      developing fetus and has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. An 
      anti-inflammatory diet could be a promising avenue to combat the pro-inflammatory 
      state of pregnancy, particularly in obese women, but we lack mechanistic data 
      linking this dietary pattern during pregnancy to inflammation and birth outcomes. In 
      an ethnically diverse cohort of 1057 mother-child pairs, we estimated the 
      relationships between dietary inflammatory potential [measured via the 
      energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (E-DII™)] and birth outcomes overall, as 
      well as by offspring sex and maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). In a 
      subset of women, we also explored associations between E-DII, circulating cytokines 
      (n = 105), and offspring methylation (n = 338) as potential modulators of these 
      relationships using linear regression. Adjusted regression models revealed that 
      women with pro-inflammatory diets had elevated rates of preterm birth among female 
      offspring [β = -0.22, standard error (SE) = 0.07, P<0.01], but not male offspring 
      (β=0.09, SE = 0.06, P<0.12) (P(interaction) = 0.003). Similarly, we observed 
      pro-inflammatory diets were associated with higher rates of caesarean delivery among 
      obese women (β = 0.17, SE = 0.08, P = 0.03), but not among women with BMI <25 
      kg/m(2) (P(interaction) = 0.02). We observed consistent inverse associations between 
      maternal inflammatory cytokine concentrations (IL-12, IL-17, IL-4, IL-6, and TNFα) 
      and lower methylation at the MEG3 regulatory sequence (P<0.05); however, results did 
      not support the link between maternal E-DII and circulating cytokines. We replicate 
      work by others on the association between maternal inflammatory diet and adverse 
      pregnancy outcomes and provide the first empirical evidence supporting the inverse 
      association between circulating cytokine concentrations and offspring methylation.

TI  - PRC2 Is Required to Maintain Expression of the Maternal Gtl2-Rian-Mirg Locus by 
      Preventing De Novo DNA Methylation in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.

AB  - Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) function and DNA methylation (DNAme) are 
      typically correlated with gene repression. Here, we show that PRC2 is required to 
      maintain expression of maternal microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs 
      (lncRNAs) from the Gtl2-Rian-Mirg locus, which is essential for full pluripotency of 
      iPSCs. In the absence of PRC2, the entire locus becomes transcriptionally repressed 
      due to gain of DNAme at the intergenic differentially methylated regions (IG-DMRs). 
      Furthermore, we demonstrate that the IG-DMR serves as an enhancer of the maternal 
      Gtl2-Rian-Mirg locus. Further analysis reveals that PRC2 interacts physically with 
      Dnmt3 methyltransferases and reduces recruitment to and subsequent DNAme at the 
      IG-DMR, thereby allowing for proper expression of the maternal Gtl2-Rian-Mirg locus. 
      Our observations are consistent with a mechanism through which PRC2 counteracts the 
      action of Dnmt3 methyltransferases at an imprinted locus required for full 
      pluripotency.
